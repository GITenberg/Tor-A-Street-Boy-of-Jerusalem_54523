        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor was hungry.
        Hunger was a common experience in Tor’s short life; he merely
        tightened the dingy rags about his middle and continued to stare at
        the group of sparrows quarreling noisily in the red dust of the
        street. It had occurred to Tor that the life of a sparrow must be
        vastly pleasanter than that of a boy. <span class="tei tei-q">“They
        find plenty to eat,”</span> he told himself enviously, as he hugged
        his lean little body. With a sudden impulse the child flung a pebble
        into <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name=
        "Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the midst of the
        belligerents. The birds shook the dust from their ruffled feathers
        with noisy clamor of dismay, darted into the bright air, and
        disappeared far above the tops of the tallest houses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor laughed aloud
        as a second idea struggled with the first in his clouded brain; then
        he checked himself thoughtfully, and, winding his rags more closely
        about him, trotted noiselessly away down the street.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chelluh, the blind
        beggar, for more years than one could count on the fingers of both
        hands the undisputed proprietor of a snug corner just within the
        Damascus gate, was shaking his brazen cup after his daily custom. The
        cup rattled bravely, for certain coins had already been dropped
        therein by the charitable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have mercy, kind lords of Jerusalem; have mercy on the
        sorrows of one born <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg
        15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>blind!”</span> chanted the beggar in his whining
        monotone. <span class="tei tei-q">“Kind lords, beautiful ladies, only
        a denarius, I beseech of you, and may the blessings of
        heaven—”</span> The blind man paused, his quick ear catching the
        sound of a hesitating footfall amid the hurrying steps which passed
        in and out at the open gate. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now may Jove,
        Jehovah, and all lesser gods be gracious unto thee, noble
        sir,”</span> he began.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On a sudden this
        professional plaint broke into a bellow of anger and alarm.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Help! Thieves! Murder!”</span> he cried.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My money—my hard-earned money! Some one has
        stolen my money!”</span> No one appearing to pay the slightest heed
        to his outcries, the beggar beat upon the ground in a very fury of
        impotent rage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor, standing well
        out of range of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg
        16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>whirling staff, regarded the blind man with a
        pleased smile. For the moment he had quite forgotten that he was
        hungry. <span class="tei tei-q">“Aha! my very good master,”</span> he
        cried tauntingly, <span class="tei tei-q">“and who is it who will
        fast to-day—ay, and perchance to-morrow!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sound of the
        shrill childish voice the beggar sprang to his feet with a vile
        imprecation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it thou, spawn of the dust,
        who hast dared rob me?”</span> he screamed, making a vicious rush in
        the direction of the voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come hither,
        that I may break every bone of thy thieving body!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What if I choose not to be beaten?”</span> inquired Tor,
        coolly evading the groping fingers of the beggar. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What if I will to exchange thy good coin for bread?
        Yesterday thou gav’st me naught save a beating; to-day I have had but
        a bellyful <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg
        17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        curses. I tell thee I will serve thee no longer. May Jove, Jehovah,
        and all lesser gods be gracious unto thee!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this mocking
        farewell the boy darted away, and, being for the moment almost as
        unseeing as his late master by reason of the hunger which tore him
        urgently, ran straight into the arms of a man who had been curiously
        watching the scene from the shelter of an archway.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let me go!”</span> shrieked Tor, striving with all his
        puny strength to writhe out of the powerful grasp of his captor.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me go, I say!”</span> Then, like the
        little animal that he was, he twisted about and buried his sharp
        white teeth in the brown hand that held him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ouf! verily thou art a wolf-whelp!”</span> cried the
        stranger, lightly cuffing the child’s ears. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hold hard, small one, till <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Didst thou steal his money, boy?”</span> asked the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Tor, his big, bright eyes fixed upon
        the beggar in manifest terror. <span class="tei tei-q">“I was hungry.

        beggar, feeling after the child with a ferocious chuckle.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Give him to me—ah!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not so fast, friend, not so fast,”</span> said the
        stranger quietly, drawing the boy away from the grimy talons
        outstretched to seize him. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is thy son,
        sayst thou? Why, then, is the child starving and naked, whilst thou
        art sleek and well covered? Why is he bruised and bleeding like the
        dog thou didst call him, whilst thou art whole?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beggar bared
        his yellow teeth in a malevolent smile. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why,
        herein is a marvel,”</span> he said softly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A noble stranger—for thy speech betrayeth thee, kind
        sir—come to Jerusalem for the passover, perchance, for love, for
        war—the gods alone know thine errand—but delaying his so honorable
        affairs, his so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg

        brat. Sacred fire, but I am bowed to the earth before thy most noble
        condescension, who am not worthy to touch the hem of thy honorable
        garment. I have said that the boy is mine. If he be hungry, if he be
        naked, if he be bruised—what is that to a stranger from Galilee?
        Truly, he is but a dog of the gutters, but even a dog hath eyes and
        may be useful to one in my misfortune.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wilt thou that I give thee into the hand of thy
        father?”</span> asked the Galilean of the child, who no longer
        struggled to free himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The man is not my father,”</span> mumbled Tor

        Permit me to salute thee, most honorable stranger, ’tis already over
        long that we keep thee from thy business—my son and I.”</span> And,
        leaning forward as if to humbly kiss the stranger’s robe, the beggar
        laid violent hands on the trembling child. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oho! I have my fingers on thee at last, rat of the
        gutter. Come now, and we will settle our matters! Five denarii, it
        was. Brr—Veil of the temple! what now?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stranger had
        forcibly relaxed the clutch of the bony fingers. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Here is thy money,”</span> he said, counting out from
        his broad palm the coins which the child passed over to him with a
        look of piteous appeal. <span class="tei tei-q">“Five denarii, saidst
        thou. As for the lad, if he hath the proper love for thee he will

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost hear me, Galilean? A swine—swine—swine!
        Thy father, also, and the father of thy father, thy mother—sacred
        fire! Help! Help!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beggar lay
        sprawling in the dust, under a well-directed blow from the Galilean’s
        powerful fist. The stranger stood over him, breathing deep, his dark
        eyes flashing baleful fire. Then, shrugging his shoulders slightly
        and muttering certain strange words under his breath, he stooped,
        picked up the beggar quite gently, and set him in his place.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is thy staff, thy cup, and thy money,
        friend,”</span> he said calmly, ignoring the torrent of imprecation
        which issued from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg
        23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        open month of the beggar like a foul stream. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My Master hath taught me that even such refuse as thou
        must be handled with love. But, hark ye, fellow, no man may defile

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beggar
        strained his sightless eyes after the departing footfalls.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Peter, the fisherman,”</span> he repeated
        with a ferocious smile. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, most honorable

        gains a sacrifice—a yearling lamb, no less. I will, I swear
        it.”</span></p>

        having thus made for himself an enemy, plunged into one of the narrow
        streets leading toward the temple. He was still breathing deep, and
        thrust his pilgrim’s staff fiercely into the red dust of the gloomy
        thoroughfare. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who am I that I should follow
        a prophet?”</span> he demanded of himself angrily. <span class=

        He stopped short and presently spied Tor’s <span class="tei tei-pb"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor laughed aloud.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is well,”</span> he said briefly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I bite like a dog because I hate like a dog and hunger
        like a dog,”</span> replied Tor slowly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I

        thou didst take the money from me by force. Which is better? Nay,
        Galilean, I will not eat with thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stranger sat
        down upon a stone with an air of indifference. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am hungry,”</span> he said, and, producing a brown
        loaf and a handful of olives from his pouch, began to eat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Little by little
        the child crept nearer. Presently he stretched out one puny hand and
        snatched a fragment of bread which the man carelessly let fall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah, thou?”</span> said the Galilean, with an air of
        surprise, and let fall another bit. Later he placed a large piece of
        the bread on the stone at his side and looked away at the tops of the
        houses.</p>

        satisfied?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why didst thou hold me when I would not?”</span>
        inquired the child. <span class="tei tei-q">“Was my doing any
        business of thine?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man shrugged
        his shoulders. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> he replied
        doggedly, <span class="tei tei-q">“it was not. Moreover, I should
        have been attending to the beam in mine own eye. I have been taught

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who told thee it was an evil thing to fight,
        Galilean?”</span> asked the boy curiously. He was sitting quite
        confidently now at the stranger’s side, munching bread and olives.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I say it is not evil—<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that is, unless one is beaten. Then,
        indeed, it is evil. But one may always curse another. I have learned
        divers strong curses—ay, I am able to curse a man or a beast in many
        tongues.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have a Master, one Jesus of Nazareth,”</span> said the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God forbid!”</span> murmured the Galilean. He stared
        thoughtfully at the famished child, who was devouring the last crumbs
        of bread. <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou filled?”</span> he
        asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor shrugged his
        thin shoulders. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is the dry bed of Kedron

        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have eaten. I—”</span> He stopped short
        and fixed his bright eyes on the Galilean’s hurt hand, which he had
        thrust into a fold of his tunic. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me see

        head. <span class="tei tei-q">“It hurts me, also, now that I have
        eaten thy bread,”</span> he faltered. Then to the immense
        astonishment of the man, he burst into a passion of weeping, his
        rough head bowed upon his scarred knees. An evil-looking dog which
        had been hungrily watching the scene from an angle in the wall
        skulked rapidly toward the child, and thrust his lean carcass between
        the two; the Galilean sprang to his feet with a muttered imprecation
        and threatening up-raised staff.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Stop!”</span> cried Tor, in sudden fury. <span class=

        him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man looked on
        in horrified amazement while the child wound his thin arms about the
        shaggy neck of the brute, murmuring gently, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“See, here is yet a bit of bread for thee, good Baladan.
        Eat, my friend, eat, it is good bread.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dog licked the
        child’s bare feet and whined his delight. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Didst thou not know, boy, that dogs are unclean and evil
        brutes?”</span> demanded the Galilean with an air of profound
        disgust. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, thou art thyself unclean and
        evil, and I must away to my Master.”</span> He turned his back upon
        the child and strode away, his head bent, his eyes fixed gloomily
        upon the ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor watched him
        furtively. Then, with a word to the dog, which obediently
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031"
        id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>slunk back into his chosen
        lair, he trotted noiselessly after the man. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will see where the stranger goes,”</span> he told
        himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child had not
        followed the Galilean far when the dull rumbling of chariot-wheels
        and the sharp crack of a whip warned him out of the narrow
        thoroughfare. He flattened himself against a convenient wall and
        stared greedily at the sight. This could be no less than a Roman
        official of high rank; the boy knew it right well; his eyes roved
        eagerly over the rich appointments of the chariot, and fastened
        inquiringly on the frowning face of the man who guided the plunging
        horses. A second man stood at the driver’s side, a man wearing a
        tunic and toga richly bordered with the imperial purple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor drew his
        breath sharply in pleased <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg
        32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>astonishment. Then he saw that the chariot was
        hotly pursued by a crowd of gamins like himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis the Roman Pilate himself,”</span> he chuckled,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and perchance he will presently cast out
        coin like grain from the fat pouch at his girdle.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A shrill cry burst
        from the child’s lips as he joined the rabble at the chariot-wheels.
        To run, to shout, to feel the glad thud of the falling coin; to
        wrestle fiercely in the dust, to arise victorious, to eat and drink
        the fruits of conquest—this was no new thing to Tor. And what,
        indeed, was the random sting of a Roman lash—even when it chanced to
        fall on naked limbs or shoulders—to the glory of the chase?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man who held
        the whip plied it vigorously before and behind with loud imprecations
        in an unknown tongue, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg
        33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>while
        he who wore the imperial purple stared frowningly into vacancy, his
        hands clasped loosely behind his back.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor’s swift feet
        gained on the chariot. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hail, great
        Pilate!”</span> he shouted impudently, <span class="tei tei-q">“art
        deaf? art blind? art palsied? Give us now of the temple treasure!
        Ay—give! give!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman’s dull
        eyes flashed baleful fire. The fact that he had attempted to seize
        large sums from the temple treasuries, and that the Jews hated him
        for it, was no secret in Jerusalem. But must the very gamins of the
        street taunt him with the fact? He snatched the lash from the driver
        and plied it himself with a practiced hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor fell back with
        a shriek of keenest agony.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chariot and
        the rabble swept on and disappeared, leaving the child <span class=

        animal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whip, fringed

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Tor, groaning
        in the wordless anguish of his hurts, came a soft inquiring touch on
        his heaving shoulders. Led by that kind instinct which guides all
        wounded creatures, the child had crawled away and hidden himself from
        unfriendly eyes in the mouth of a ruinous sewer hard by. Here he had
        lain long hours, exhausted with agony. The dog snuffed the small
        huddled figure from head to foot with short, anxious whines. Then he
        fell to industriously licking the one limp brown hand which crept out
        from beneath the ragged tunic.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Baladan,”</span> whispered Tor, and shrieked aloud with
        the intolerable smart of rising tears in his blinded eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shriek, faint
        as it was, reached the ears of a second boy, who was searching
        carefully from side to side of the gloomy little thoroughfare.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“’Tis thou, Tor,”</span> he exclaimed,
        stooping to stare in at the sewer’s mouth. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Art bad hurt?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, Dan, the accursed lash of the Roman smote my
        eyes,”</span> groaned the child, and sputtered out some strange
        maledictions in the Egyptian tongue, which he had learned from his
        late master.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second boy
        pursed up his coarse lips into a soft whistle of comprehension. Then
        he bent down and stared briefly into the drooped face of the
        half-delirious sufferer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Body of
        Bacchus!”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg
        37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he
        murmured, smiting his bare thigh with closed fist. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“One more blind beggar in Jerusalem.”</span> Then raising
        his fingers to his lips he gave vent to a shrill cry of summons. It
        was promptly answered by the soft thud of a water-carrier’s feet and
        the loud tinkle of his brazen cups.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give him to drink,”</span> commanded Dan, indicating Tor
        with a grimy forefinger. <span class="tei tei-q">“The poor fool hath
        brought ill-fortune upon himself. ’Tis the evil eye of a
        surety.”</span> With that he produced a copper coin, which the
        water-carrier acknowledged with a cup of water from the goat-skin on
        his back.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will come again at sunset and give him to
        drink,”</span> said the water-carrier, with a sidelong glance of fear
        and pity. Then the two departed, leaving Tor to his
        misery.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg
        38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How the child
        lived through the days and weeks that followed only Baladan knew. The
        dog warmed his master’s pinched body at night, keeping at bay other
        prowling beasts of the pariah race which ranged the deserted streets,
        as lawless and almost as fierce as wolves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He even fed him,
        more than once bringing fragments of bread and fish, stolen from a
        vender’s stall at the imminent peril of his life. Occasionally the
        friendly water-carrier visited the suffering boy, and the little wild
        children of the street, swarming like sparrows in the streets of
        Jerusalem, shared their infrequent crusts with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By slow degrees
        the anguish of his wounds grew less poignant. The cruelly disfigured
        eyes were indeed wholly darkened, but they ceased to send burning
        shafts of fire to the tortured brain. The <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>child slept fitfully, ate what he could get, and
        one day even smiled. This when Baladan brought him a meatless bone,
        laying it down at his feet with extravagant expressions of
        satisfaction. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, good Baladan,”</span>
        murmured Tor, patting his friend’s shaggy coat; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“indeed I am not hungry to-day. Eat, dear beast,”</span>
        and he thrust the bone into the dog’s mouth, and closed his sharp
        teeth upon it. Baladan understood, and the two rested together in the
        sunshine with something like real content.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The charitable
        water-carrier had bestowed one of his brazen cups upon the blind boy,
        and this with his ruined eyes became his stock in trade. Little by
        little he learned to send forth the dolorous plaint of the blind
        mendicant. After a time he could find his way from place to place
        with the aid of the dog. And so <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>it came to pass that there was one more blind
        beggar in Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once during these
        evil days of his darkness Tor fell in with his old master. It was on
        this wise: the child, grown bolder, had made his way farther than his
        wont into the more crowded thoroughfares of the city, and there his
        shrill cry for alms sounded loud and clear above the tumult of the
        market-place. He rattled his cup bravely as was the custom of the
        professional beggar, sending forth into the unfriendly world the old
        familiar plaint of the beggar, Chelluh. <span class="tei tei-q">“Have
        mercy, kind lords of Jerusalem; have mercy on the sorrows of one born
        blind! Kind lord, kind lady, only a denarius, I beseech thee, and may
        Jehovah and all lesser gods be gracious unto thee!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it chanced
        that Chelluh himself had also come to the market-place to beg
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041"
        id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>alms, and, hearing the child’s
        voice afar off, recognized it with the unerring ear of the blind.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Fetch me now to the voice that crieth my
        cry,”</span> he commanded the one that led him. And when presently he
        was come to the place where Tor stood in the safe angle of two
        windowless walls, he stopped short with a malevolent smile.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Art thou of a surety blind, my son—that thou stealest my
        cry for alms as thou didst once steal my money?”</span> he
        demanded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor trembled like
        a leaf in the wind at sound of the cruel voice. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Alas, I am indeed blind, good master,”</span> he said
        beseechingly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Have mercy upon me, for
        I—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prayer ended
        in a muffled shriek for help as the blind man hurled himself upon the
        blind child, griping him in a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>very fury of malicious hatred. No one
        interfered. What, indeed, was the quarrel of two beggars in an angle
        of the wall?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Trade pressed hard
        in Jerusalem as elsewhere, and a man must mind naught save his own
        business if he would prosper. So no one glanced that way when the
        blind man, having satisfied his lust for revenge, departed, leaving
        the child’s limp body upon the ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor was not dead.
        He was only bruised and beaten and choked into insensibility, and
        after awhile he revived and crawled feebly away with the faithful
        Baladan. His begging-cup was gone, and he no longer dared to raise
        his voice to crave alms from the passers-by. Occasionally one tossed
        him a coin or a crust, but for the most part the child crouched all
        day in his corner motionless, starving. And the days and weeks
        dragged by.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg
        43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was sitting
        thus one morning when the sun had climbed high enough to flood his
        darkened nook with yellow light. Tor could feel the warmth of its
        radiance in his chill darkness. He sighed deeply and spread forth his
        lean hands, wondering dully what it would be like to see once more.
        He had already forgotten the blue sky and the moving clouds, the
        flutter of green leaves over high garden walls and the glistening
        whir of bird-wings in the sunshine. His night was endless, unbroken
        by morning gleam or noontide glory. It meant cold and hunger and a
        thousand nameless miseries which he endured because he must endure.
        It would stretch on and on, he thought, to some far-off, hopeless
        end, when perchance he might sleep to awaken no more.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor had looked
        upon such sleepers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg
        44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with
        a scared creeping of the flesh in the old days of seeing. Now the
        sleep seemed good, and quite stupidly and vaguely he longed for
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somewhere, afar
        off, there was shouting and a sound of voices that chanted musically.
        The child listened with the sharpened attention which had grown to be
        his one defence and solace. In the old days his flying feet would
        have borne him swiftly enough to see what was happening. Now he could
        only listen, and wonder.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perhaps ’tis some great prince come to
        Jerusalem,”</span> he muttered, and tried to picture to himself the
        gay pageant of the marching troops, the gorgeous uniforms, the
        jeweled robes of the nobles, the chariots, the horses. And now the
        shouting grew louder, there was a noise of swift-hurrying feet, of
        confused ques<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg
        45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tions
        and answers, while above all rose the clear musical voices of myriads
        of children crying in the rhythmic measures of the temple chorals:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed—Blessed
        is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the
        highest!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor started
        uncertainly to his feet, a strange, new longing for something he knew
        not what stealing into his starved soul. Baladan whined uneasily,
        then, running to the street-corner and back again to his helpless
        master, began to utter short excited barks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child’s thin
        fingers trailed the rough wall askingly; his timid feet crept nearer
        to the jubilant procession. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna—Hosanna
        to the King! Hosanna to the Son of David!”</span> He had reached the
        open square, and, fearing to go fur<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>ther, he sank down once more in the shelter of a
        friendly column, hot tears stealing from his darkened eyes.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, Baladan,”</span> he moaned, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“if I could only see!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the sweet
        chanting was growing momently fainter. Tor followed the procession in
        fancy. It was moving toward the temple, he knew,—that great pile of
        stone and marble and gold which towered above the tumultuous streets
        of Jerusalem like the glistening palace of a dream. Now it had passed
        into the outer courts, and a great and singular silence fell upon the
        city.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was broken
        after what seemed hours of waiting by light and rapid footfalls.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Tor,”</span> cried an eager, breathless
        voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where art thou?—Tor!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Here!”</span> answered the blind boy, starting to his
        feet and straining his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg
        47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sightless eyes in the direction of the voice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Here am I. What wilt thou, Dan?”</span> For
        he knew the voice and the step of his friend.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have come to fetch thee to the temple,”</span>
        breathed the boy excitedly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou must come
        quickly, before the King has gone away to his palace.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Did the King scatter coins among the crowd?”</span>
        asked Tor eagerly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Are the soldiers giving
        bread and alms to the people, as when Pilate came to
        Jerusalem?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, the man is like no other great one who ever came to
        Jerusalem,”</span> answered Dan wonderingly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is verily a King though. Didst thou not hear the
        people shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Blessed is the King that
        cometh!’</span> Hark you, the man is a strange King. He wears no
        crown, no jewels; he hath no soldiers, no money for <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the people. He came into the city riding
        on the colt of an ass; but the people cast even their garments upon
        the earth before him. I saw it, and shouted with the rest; and
        because I had no coat, I cut a green branch from a tree and cast it
        beneath the feet of his beast. So also did many others, when they saw
        what I had done. They cut palm-branches, olive-branches, and acacias
        from fields and gardens all along the way; ’twas a great sight! The
        big turbans came out in a rage to shut our mouths, but for once they
        could not. Come,—thou must come!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why should I come?”</span> said Tor mournfully.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am only a beggar—and blind.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        the little brown sparrows which flit among the great feet of horses
        in a crowded thoroughfare. And when they had come to the place where

        of their petitions mingled with the jubilant thanksgivings of those
        already healed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Here, get thee betwixt these two cripples,”</span>
        whispered Dan urgently. <span class="tei tei-q">“Fasten thou onto
        this man’s tunic—so! Now go, and come again—seeing. I will wait for
        thee by this third pillar. Thou wilt see me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blind boy
        stumbled on behind his crippled guide, his heart beating so loud in
        his ears that he could scarce hear what the Voice said to him. But
        the thrilling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg
        51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>touch
        on his sightless eyes sank to the depths of his soul. He
        saw—Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some one was
        pushing him from behind; Tor yielded to the pressure without a
        word—without a sound. His great eyes, wide and bright, still remained
        fastened upon the man who had healed him; but he uttered no sound of
        rejoicing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Dan, watching
        beside the third pillar, came a sudden sickening sense of defeat. He
        made his way through the crowd and again laid forcible hands upon
        Tor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let me alone,”</span> commanded Tor briefly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I want to look at the man.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Canst see him?”</span> inquired Dan incredulously.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor made no
        answer. He was thinking confusedly, vaguely, while one fixed purpose
        formed and lifted itself like a great, radiant light in his darkened
        un<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052"
        id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>derstanding. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I shall follow him,”</span> he said aloud, and his thin
        face shone strangely. <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall see him
        always.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Canst thou see, lad?”</span> cried Dan, griping his
        friend’s shoulders impatiently, <span class="tei tei-q">“or art thou
        crazed as well as blind?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor turned his
        bright eyes upon the other boy. <span class="tei tei-q">“Can I
        see?”</span> he echoed, and laughed aloud. Then, in a sudden ecstasy,
        he leaped upon a balustrade and shouted aloud the word which he had
        heard afar off in his darkness: <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna!
        Hosanna! Hosanna in the highest!”</span> Myriads of child voices took
        up the cry, and it arose into the blue heavens far—far beyond the
        smoke of the sacrificial fires, till it mingled with the songs of
        angels before the great white throne. And there was joy in
        Heaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun was
        setting behind the mountains before hunger, more potent than even the
        temple police with its flail-like rods of office, had cleared the
        great court of the temple. The sick and blind, the maimed and palsied
        had gone away restored, the multitude, sated with miracle and weary
        of shouting, followed. The Nazarene himself, looking more worn and
        thoughtful than his wont, also departed with the twelve, his
        disciples bearing themselves haughtily under the angry eyes of the
        priests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last their
        Master had declared him<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg
        54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>self
        before the nation. All the city had heard the royal acclamation. The
        promised reign of the house of David was about to be restored in
        Jerusalem. Already they felt themselves to be princes and governors
        in a kingdom of unimagined splendor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter, the
        Galilean, as he followed with the others after the pale, potent
        worker of miracles, who was also a King, became aware of a determined
        clutch upon his abba, and, looking down, beheld with amazement and
        displeasure the small, pinched face of Tor. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have nothing for thee, beggar,”</span> he said
        quickly, and pulled his garment impatiently away from the child’s
        clinging touch.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, but I am not begging,”</span> said Tor, in nowise
        abashed. <span class="tei tei-q">“The man—yonder—is he thy
        Master?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is that to thee?”</span> frowned the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>future prince of Israel. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Get thee gone, the King is passing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The King—thy Master—healed me but now of
        blindness,”</span> persisted the child. <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        is his name? Nay, I will not loose thee till I know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His name is Jesus,”</span> said Peter unwillingly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now begone.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will not,”</span> said Tor positively, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for I also have chosen him for my Master.”</span> But he
        loosed his hold on the man’s garment and fell back a few paces.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall follow him,”</span> he told himself
        simply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just what he
        expected from his new Master Tor could have told no one. He did not
        put the question to himself. He was again both hungry and thirsty;
        but he had cared little for either hunger or thirst in his evil past.
        Now he tightened the rags cheerfully about his middle in the old
        familiar way and trotted noise<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>lessly after the little group of men, in the
        midst of which walked his Master.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child was
        trying dully to recall what the Galilean had said concerning this man
        on the day he had delivered him out of the hand of Chelluh by the
        Damascus gate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thought of
        Chelluh brought a new purpose uppermost. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When I find a convenient season from following my Master
        I will return and beat the blind beggar even as he beat me,”</span>
        he promised himself, with a new and savage joy in his restored sight.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath eyes is truly a god, and to
        know this one might well be blind for a season.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His new Master,
        surrounded by his little guard, had passed quite out of the city by
        this time, and all were walking swiftly on one of the level Roman
        roads which bound Jerusalem to its heathen <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Emperor. Tor followed unperceived in the
        gathering dusk of evening. After a little the party reached a small
        village, entered it, and paused before a large and beautiful garden
        enclosure, where they were evidently expected, for they were
        immediately admitted and the doors shut fast behind them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor marked the
        place well, then, not knowing what else to do, he returned to
        Jerusalem, found Baladan, and spent the night in one of his old
        haunts near the Damascus Gate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the child
        awoke in the morning the marvelous events of the previous day floated
        before his wide eyes like the misty fragments of a half-forgotten
        dream. <span class="tei tei-q">“Was I indeed blind?”</span> he asked
        himself; <span class="tei tei-q">“or was that also an evil dream of
        night?”</span> Baladan’s anxious whine recalled him more fully to his
        waking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name=
        "Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>senses, and he sprang
        up to find Dan shying olive-stones at him from a neighboring wall.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sleepy-head!”</span> quoth the gamin,
        discharging another volley of stones. <span class="tei tei-q">“Look
        you, lad, there is much to be seen in Jerusalem to-day—if, indeed,
        the man restored thy sight—the passover pilgrims are coming in by
        thousands. I have already begged breakfast for me and for
        thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can see as well as ever,”</span> said Tor briefly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But I must first find my Master. Give me the
        loaf and I will go.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Beggar!”</span> cried Dan, tossing his comrade a
        fragment of a loaf and half a dozen olives, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what hast thou to do with a King? Come, we will lead a
        merry life this week; the pilgrims are laden with goods, and one with
        light fingers and lighter heels need lack nothing.”</span> The boy
        snapped his brown fingers and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class=

        exuberance of his spirits.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do not beat thine
        enemy; but if thine enemy smite thee, let him smite thee again, if he
        will,’</span> ”</span> said Tor, munching his bread reflectively.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“There is Chelluh; he hath beaten me, not
        once nor twice only, but many times.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who said <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do not smite thine

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My Master said it. He said it to the Galilean, not to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“I do not know; but if I will serve him, then will he be

        it.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How?”</span> persisted Dan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor stared about
        him reflectively. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will bring him blind
        folks to heal,”</span> he said at last. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        can do that.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou art a rare fool,”</span> said Dan conclusively.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am off for the pilgrim encampment outside
        the walls. Look you, beggar, when thou art through with serving the
        King, thy Master, thou wilt find me there eating the fat and drinking
        the sweet,”</span> and with a laugh of scorn the boy darted away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Left to himself,
        Tor sat for a long time deep in thought; an astonishing picture had
        presented itself to his mind, born out of the unseen whence cometh
        every good and perfect thing in all the visible world. The child
        seemed to see himself leading his old master, Chelluh, to the healing
        King, and Chelluh, restored to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sight, crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna,
        hosanna in the highest!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Far off and faint
        upon the morning air a voice arose, rising and falling in dolorous
        monotone. Tor knew it. It was the voice of Chelluh begging alms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He arose and ran
        with swift feet to the place which he had hated and avoided even in
        his dreams, and there in the familiar angle of the wall sat the
        beggar, shaking his empty cup, the sun falling full upon his evil
        face. Tor stood quite still and gazed at the blind man with his
        Christ-touched eyes, and for the first time in his short life, loving
        pity for another welled up within him. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Master,”</span> he said, in a low voice. Then he drew
        nearer, and spoke in a louder voice; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chelluh.”</span> He would call no man master save
        one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blind beggar
        beat upon his cup <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg
        62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with
        his horny knuckles. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who calls me?”</span> he
        asked, scarce believing his truthful ears which told him whose voice
        had spoken. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who calls me?”</span> he
        repeated, trembling. <span class="tei tei-q">“I choked the little dog
        to death, yet it is his voice that speaks.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou didst not kill me,”</span> said Tor. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am alive, and see once more. Yesterday the King, my
        Master, healed me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lies!”</span> mumbled Chelluh, shaking his great
        head,—<span class="tei tei-q">“thou wast always a liar.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chelluh reflected
        for a moment. Physically he was stronger than the puny child. Yet he
        distrusted his words. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art plotting
        mischief against me, gutter rat,”</span> he growled, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I know thee.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If I plotted mischief I should have come upon thee
        suddenly, and run away ere thou wast aware of me,”</span> replied
        Tor. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am no man’s fool, but I serve a new
        Master, one Jesus. ’Tis for my Master I do this. He heals blind folk,
        therefore I fetch blind folk to him to be healed. Thus I serve my
        Master. Wilt thou come?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chelluh rose
        slowly to his feet. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will come,”</span> he
        said; <span class="tei tei-q">“but if thou hast lied to me, little
        dog, thou knowest the strength of my hands, and shalt know again.
        This time I will kill thee beyond a peradventure.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor shuddered at
        the familiar clutch of the knotted fingers on his slender shoulders.
        Yet he walked bravely forward. <span class="tei tei-q">“So I serve my
        Master,”</span> he said aloud.</p>

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>peated Tor confidently. Then he shouted
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna!”</span> in his shrill childish
        voice, as he had done the day before. The cry was echoed by myriads
        of voices both far and near.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chelluh’s heavy
        hand descended upon his guide’s curly head. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Be silent, fool,”</span> he hissed. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is tumult ahead. Keep clear of the crowd, I say,
        and look sharp!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were near the
        main entrance of the temple now, and the stream of newcomers was met
        by an excited mob of people coming out. Imprecations, shouts, and
        loud angry cries blended confusedly with the whir of moving wings,
        for a great cloud of doves hovered uncertainly over the place, now
        flying, now settling on the roofs and pinnacles of the marble
        porticoes. Chelluh stopped determinedly and snuffed the air like an
        animal.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg
        66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is going on within?”</span> he demanded of Tor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question was
        answered by a woman in a foreign head-dress who chanced to pause in
        the crowd beside them. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Nazarene has
        thrust out the sellers of doves and the money-changers from the great
        court,”</span> she said laughingly. <span class="tei tei-q">“With
        these eyes I saw it. The Prophet cast down the tables with no gentle
        hand, loosed the doves, and drove out the craven Jews before him like
        a flock of frightened sheep. ’Twas a great sight. Also, the money was
        scattered all over the court among the multitude. Even I, a Gentile,
        am the richer for it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Money?”</span> exclaimed the blind beggar greedily.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, let us go in, I would I had eyes that
        I might glean of this harvest.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The man gives eyes also for the asking,”</span> said the
        woman indifferently. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have witnessed
        miracles of healing till I am weary of them. The Jew is a great
        magician, surely; but his own countrymen hate him, and the Romans
        care naught for miracles, so betwixt the two he will perchance fall
        to the ground.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor was not
        listening, he was watching for a good opening through which to pilot
        his blind charge. <span class="tei tei-q">“When thou art healed, thou
        wilt become a servant of the King,”</span> he said softly in the ear
        of the blind beggar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ay, and will I?”</span> sneered Chelluh; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and what will I do then?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fetch blind folks to be healed,”</span> said the child
        simply. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now I see him,”</span> he added,
        with joyful certainty. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do but follow quickly
        and thou shalt be blind no longer!”</span></p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like the showers
        and sunshine of the Father which bless the good and the evil alike
        through all the years of all the ages, so was the healing power of
        him who manifested the Father in every act of his life. And so it
        came to pass that many came to be healed of blindness in those last
        great days, and went away with seeing eyes and blind souls.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chelluh’s first
        act after receiving his sight was to stare hard at Tor. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am minded to know thee again,”</span> he said
        thoughtfully.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boy shivered
        beneath his gaze. Chelluh with seeing eyes was even more terrible
        than Chelluh blind. Those devouring eyes were roving like the eyes of
        a beast of prey over the excited crowd. They fastened at last on a
        man who stood not far from the Nazarene. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        know <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name=
        "Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that man’s
        voice,”</span> said Chelluh. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who and what is
        he?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is a servant of the King,”</span> said Tor.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“His name is Peter.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His name is Peter,”</span> repeated Chelluh, and struck
        his palms together softly. He turned and without another word plunged
        into the crowd and was gone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor forgot him
        presently. He was edging his way nearer and nearer to the wondrous
        Voice. Jesus was teaching the people, and his words fell upon the
        child’s ignorant ears with a strange and potent charm. He could not
        understand; but he listened because he loved; and, listening and
        loving, he comprehended something of what was being said, even as a
        babe discerns the speech of its mother. Love answereth love, as deep
        calleth unto deep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At night Tor
        followed his Master and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg
        70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        twelve when they went forth out of the city to lodge in the house of
        his friends in Bethany. This time the child slept on the ground in
        the shelter of the garden wall, begging a crust and a cup of water
        from one of the villagers at dawn. No one questioned the boy and so
        he was able again to follow almost at their heels when the little
        party set out for Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
        withered fig-tree near the wayside, and Tor heard the Galilean,
        Peter, pause and say to his Master, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rabbi,
        behold the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered away.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Jesus looked
        upon the withered tree and answered the Galilean on this wise:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Have faith in God; for I tell thee that
        whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast
        into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shall believe that what he saith cometh to
        pass; he shall have it. Therefore I say unto you, All things
        whatsoever ye pray and ask for, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">believe that ye have received
        them</span></span>, and ye shall have them. And whensoever ye stand
        praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father
        also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor was crouching
        in the shelter of a bush and heard every word distinctly. His thin
        face burned with excitement. <span class="tei tei-q">“He said
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘whosoever,’</span> ”</span> he murmured.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He said <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘whosoever.’</span> ”</span> Tor knew something of the
        custom of prayer. Many times he had seen the rich Pharisees standing
        motionless at the street-corners praying. Also, he had begged in the
        temple court, where many persons prayed aloud. For himself, he never
        prayed. The God of the Jews regarded not beg<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>gars, he told himself. Now as he crouched behind
        the bush, listening to the departing footsteps of the thirteen men,
        he began to say over to himself the word <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> which the man who had opened his eyes
        said so often.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He repeated it
        softly to himself many times. Then he sprang up and followed hard
        after his Master, vaguely comforted and glad at heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day was a long
        one, passed mainly in the great Court of the Gentiles, and Tor,
        mingling with every gaping crowd which surrounded the Nazarene, was
        puzzled and troubled by much that he saw and heard. There was no
        shouting of Hosanna to-day, no royal acclamations. The people stood
        close in serried ranks and listened doubtfully to the strange
        teachings of the King in the seamless robe—the King who wore no
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073"
        id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>crown and whose followers bore
        no arms. He was telling stories to the multitude, stories so simple
        that even a beggar could understand them. The child pressed close, so
        close that he could have touched the sandaled feet of the man who had
        opened his eyes. And so he listened to the stories of the father and
        his two undutiful sons; the absent lord of the vineyard and his
        wicked servants; the generous king who made a marriage feast for his
        son, and how it befell that the very beggars were gathered into the
        feast. The child smiled and trembled and wept aloud beneath the power
        of that wondrous Voice; more than once the Master’s deep eyes rested
        upon the small upturned face with its wistful look of adoration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And once, as he
        was speaking, the hand of Jesus rested for a moment on the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074"
        id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rough curls of the beggar’s
        head. Ah, the rapture of that moment! Tor knew now deep in his heart
        that he was the accepted servant of the King. He could have remained
        there forever listening to the stories; but the temple police began
        to clear away the crowd with loud authoritative cries and random
        thrusts of their gilded poles of office.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Make way!”</span> they shouted. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Make way for the holy and reverend chief priests and the
        honorable elders of the Sanhedrim!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through the narrow
        passage thus cleared there came presently in great pomp and glory a
        stately delegation from the supreme council of the Jewish hierarchy.
        The chief priests wished to question publicly this worker of
        miracles—this teller of strange parables, who openly wrought his
        mighty works in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg
        75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>temple of Jehovah without their will or
        permission. <span class="tei tei-q">“By what authority doest thou
        these things?”</span> they demanded. <span class="tei tei-q">“And who
        gave thee this authority?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Jesus, calm
        and unafraid, answered them after their own custom with another
        question. <span class="tei tei-q">“I also will ask you one
        thing,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“which if ye tell me,
        I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. The
        baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        gorgeously-robed official who had put the question glanced about him
        at the hostile faces of the multitude, with a truculent air of scorn
        and contempt. Thus mumbling and stammering angrily in the midst of
        his great beard, he turned and conferred in a whisper with his
        companions. <span class="tei tei-q">“If we say, <span class=
        "tei tei-corr">From</span> heaven,”</span> he <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>muttered, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        fellow will ask, Why then did ye not believe him?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ay,”</span> quoth another, <span class="tei tei-q">“but
        if we say, From men, there is the multitude to be reckoned with, for
        all hold that John was a prophet.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so they
        presently faced the Master, their fierce eyes under the glittering
        insignia of the priestly office glaring at the calm, pale Man of
        Nazareth. <span class="tei tei-q">“We know not,”</span> they
        said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Jesus replied,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither tell I you by what authority I do
        these things.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priests
        withdrew in sullen silence, and the telling of strange stories went
        on; but Tor, somehow swept from his position by the shifting crowd,
        found himself near the defeated priests. They had paused to listen
        with the others, and were standing with folded arms and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sneering faces by one of the great pillars
        of the portico.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor slipped behind
        the column, of a sudden all ears. These men were speaking in a half
        whisper of the King, his Master. They hated him; Tor was sure of it.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The fellow will ruin us if we cannot stop
        his blatant mouth,”</span> said one. <span class="tei tei-q">“Listen
        now to his open threats: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The kingdom of God
        shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing
        forth the fruits thereof.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And he calleth himself our King,”</span> sneered
        another. <span class="tei tei-q">“A pretty pass hath the chosen
        people come to when the rabble choose a Nazaritish carpenter for
        King. Aha, I laugh at him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis no time for mirth,”</span> growled another.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The multitudes are ever agog for some new
        thing; stoning or cruci<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg
        78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>fixion is better than laughter for such an one.
        Hark you, the thing must be put down and speedily. I know a way and a
        man; he—”</span> The voice dropped to low whispers, and Tor,
        trembling with vague fright, and scarce knowing what he did, wriggled
        his way through the crowd toward the white-robed figure of Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter, the
        Galilean, was also talking excitedly with a man in the outskirts of
        the crowd. Tor fixed his eyes upon the tall, broad-shouldered
        fisherman with some confidence. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will tell
        him,”</span> he said to himself, and hovered expectantly near,
        waiting for an opportunity to speak. <span class="tei tei-q">“He must
        declare himself unmistakably and at once,”</span> the small,
        dark-faced man was saying with an impatient gesture. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This telling of pretty tales and working of miracles has
        gone <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name=
        "Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on over long, say I. We
        should arm ourselves and make ready, and the Sanhedrim must be won
        over by some great sign from heaven. We can do nothing without
        them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And I say let the Master work out his plans as it
        pleaseth him,”</span> said Peter boldly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Saw
        you not his kingly air on Sunday, Judas? He is every inch a King, I
        tell thee, and able to make of us princes and high priests—ay, and to
        sweep away all oppressors by the word of his mouth.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Able, perhaps,”</span> muttered Judas shaking his head,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but I doubt him. The man careth nothing for
        money—nothing for power. I know him. What are his plans? Does any one
        know them? Do we who are nearest him dare ask him? He is, perchance,
        nothing more than a dreamer, and our ambitions and hopes <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>are founded upon the shifting sands of his
        visions. Nay, I know what thou wouldst say, Simon. But thou art no
        statesman—no patriot. I hear the chosen people groaning in their
        slavery. I see the iron heel of Rome about to crush out the last
        lingering life of the nation. Will this man save us? Can he, I ask?
        Or is he—”</span> Judas choked convulsively, and tore at the neck of
        his garment with quivering hands. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am half
        mad with the torture of it,”</span> he groaned, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the—the waiting—the doubt; I—I fear that he—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, thou art a truculent and unbelieving fellow at
        heart,”</span> said Peter easily. <span class="tei tei-q">“Didst hear
        how the Master answered the priests but now? I could have laughed
        aloud to see them slink away like whipped curs.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Like whipped curs—yes,”</span> muttered the other.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But they will return anon <span class=

        himself. ’Tis folly—folly!”</span> He turned and plunged hastily into
        the crowd, and Peter, left to himself, began to smite his great hands
        softly together. <span class="tei tei-q">“He hath the power to put
        them all to silence,”</span> he said half aloud. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He will do it—let no one fear!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Listen, Galilean. I heard the men in long

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Galilean shook
        his great shoulders doubtfully as he stared after the small, agile
        figure of the boy, darting and doubling, twisting and turning through
        the huddled masses of people gathered about his Master. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By the double veil—”</span> he began, and stopped short

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was some new
        excitement brewing, for the fisherman was thrust rudely to one side
        by a guard of brawny temple <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg
        84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>police, who advanced as before, crying out to
        the people to fall back in the name of the Sanhedrim. The group of
        men which followed close on the heels of the guard forced another
        profane exclamation from the unguarded lips of the Galilean.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Herodians!”</span> he muttered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and Pharisees. Now, what doth this portend?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question was
        answered by Judas, who reappeared at the moment, his dark face
        distorted by a savage sneer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wouldst know
        why these courtiers of Herod have come to the Nazarene, fisherman?
        Well, I can tell thee. Our chosen Master hath of late permitted
        himself to be hailed King of the Jews, yet hath he not pledged the
        nation to the support of his claim, nor even armed us, his chosen
        followers. What then? Herod is a paltry tetrarch of Galilee, he plots
        and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name=
        "Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>schemes at Rome for his
        father’s crown. Thou mayst know, fisherman,—unless thy head be too
        thick for understanding—that the pretensions of the carpenter’s son
        have been widely noised abroad, and have already reached the ears of
        royal Herod. Jesus of Nazareth must take heed to himself or he will
        presently be dealt with after the manner of John the Baptist—or
        worse.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Get thee behind me, prophet of evil,”</span> growled
        Peter; <span class="tei tei-q">“thou hast ever the dismal croak of
        the raven. What if Herod intends to acknowledge Jesus as the lawful
        descendant of David and the promised Messiah? The tetrarch is, after
        all, a Jew, and looks for the deliverance of Israel.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas laughed
        silently, his narrow eye-slits shooting arrows of scorn at the big
        fisherman. <span class="tei tei-q">“What if the stones of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086"
        id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the temple should suddenly
        become armed troops for the defense of our sapient Master?”</span> he
        asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It might well be so,”</span> murmured Peter
        thoughtfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“Did he not walk upon the sea?
        Did he not control the lightnings and the tempest? Did he not feed
        the five thousand with one man’s victual? Hist now, they are speaking
        to him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The courtiers of
        Herod, garbed as Roman exquisites, perfumed and smiling, were
        addressing themselves to the man of Nazareth. They prefaced their
        words with extravagant obeisances, tendered with mock humility.
        Behind them stood the Pharisees alert and watchful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Listen!”</span> repeated the fisherman, his honest face
        flushed with expectancy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We know that thou art true, Rabbi,”</span> began the
        spokesman of the party, <span class="tei tei-q">“and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>carest for the opinion of no man; for thou
        regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in
        truth. Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not? Shall we
        give, or shall we not give?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus faced his
        inquisitors, erect and calm, his deep eyes searching their
        hypocritical hearts. There was silence for a full minute, while the
        crowded listeners craned their necks for his reply, and Judas
        clenched his knotted hands in a very agony of suspense. This was the
        supreme moment. Tribute to Cæsar, or no? Tribute to the usurping
        heathen emperor, or allegiance to the throne of David—which?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The carpenter’s
        son whitened slowly under the fiery eyes which scorched him with
        their brutal passions. Then came his answer—spoken slowly,
        deliberately: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg
        88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Why tempt ye me? Give
        me a penny, that I may see it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The perfumed
        exquisite from Herod’s court languidly fingered the gold pieces in
        his pouch, with a pitying smile for this penniless pretender to a
        throne, and presently, drawing therefrom one of the lesser coins of
        the empire, gave it to the Nazarene.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whose is this image and superscription?”</span> demanded
        Jesus, his voice ringing out in the crowded place like the peal of a
        great bell.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cæsar’s,”</span> replied the courtier, bowing servilely
        at mention of that name of power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came the
        wondrous answer, forever solving all questions of human fealty:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Render unto Cæsar the things that are
        Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that are
        God’s.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg
        89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly there
        arose from the multitude a great hum of approval. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well spoken!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast
        said!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold a Solomon in our
        midst!”</span> burst from one and another in deep-throated chorus.
        And the Pharisees, wrathful and menacing, withdrew with the
        crestfallen Herodians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Said I not that he was a match for the best of
        them?”</span> cried Peter, showing his white teeth in a great laugh
        of relief and triumph. <span class="tei tei-q">“Aye, our Master is
        king of a surety, wiser than any scribe is he, keener than a Damascus
        blade having two edges.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Judas groaned
        aloud. <span class="tei tei-q">“What a moment to have declared
        himself!”</span> he muttered. <span class="tei tei-q">“And lost—ay,
        lost forever. My God! what and who is the man?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor had wriggled
        his small body through the dense crowd back to the feet <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Jesus, where he crouched ready to
        spring like a faithful dog at the throat of any man who should
        threaten his Master. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no
        sword,”</span> muttered the child to himself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but I have two hands well furnished with nails, also, I
        have teeth like the teeth of Baladan. Let the men in long robes
        beware.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as yet no man
        durst lay so much as a finger on that seamless robe. Other tempters
        wearing great turbans, bearded, scowling, came to ask mocking
        questions concerning the resurrection. And on the insensate ears of
        the multitude fell those significant words which the world has
        neither comprehended nor believed to this day: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye
        not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God
        of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">God is not the God of the dead, but of the
        living.</span></span>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Afterward the
        Pharisees, rejoicing in the discomfiture of their hated rivals, the
        Sadducees, gathered again like barking wolves about a hunted quarry.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Master,”</span> asked one of them
        hypocritically, <span class="tei tei-q">“which is the great
        commandment in the law?”</span> For, they argued, if we can but draw
        this witless carpenter’s son into a discussion on the law we shall be
        able to put him to open shame before the multitude.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus answered the
        scribe without hesitation: <span class="tei tei-q">“The first
        commandment is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one;
        and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
        thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. The
        second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thyself. There is none other commandment
        greater than these.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He who had asked
        the question trembled under the searching eyes of the Nazarene. Of a
        sudden those familiar words of the temple ritual blazed within his
        darkened soul like a great light. And he answered truth with truth.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Master, thou hast well said that he is one;
        and there is none other but he; and to love him with all the
        understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as
        himself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and
        sacrifices.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Jesus said to
        this man: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art not far from the kingdom
        of God.”</span> But upon the others, who were openly sneering at
        their spokesman and muttering anathemas in their great beards, he
        presently launched the most terrible words ever spoken to man.
        Ghastly woes upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg
        93]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>woes
        reverberated in their astonished ears, while all the rottenness of
        their guilty hearts was suddenly torn open and laid bare for the
        rabble to gaze upon. <span class="tei tei-q">“Serpents, offspring of
        vipers,”</span> he called them; and hissing, crawling, stinging, they
        crept away to their dens in murderous haste, while the fickle
        multitude, roused to a very frenzy of excitement, rocked and wept
        under the prophetic wail of his closing words, heavy with
        swift-approaching doom: <span class="tei tei-q">“O Jerusalem,
        Jerusalem, which killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent
        unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even
        as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
        Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye
        shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is he that cometh in the name of the
        Lord.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Judas, who had
        heard and seen all, staggered away, blind and crazed with anger and
        despair. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ruin—ruin!”</span> he muttered.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I see naught but black ruin! In his rash
        folly the man hath cut the last rope of safety. There is but one
        chance—one. He must again quell the storm he has raised about our
        ears with the word of his power, and I—yes, I will force him to it. I
        swear it!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In that same hour
        the beggar, Tor, saw and heard what he has never forgotten to this
        moment of his eternity—nor yet will forget. Certain Greeks had come
        up to keep the passover at Jerusalem, for they had abandoned the
        pagan rites of Rome and Athens, and were trying to serve the
        invisible Jehovah. These heard speedily of the new prophet who
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095"
        id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gathered the whole city to hear
        him in the temple, and they desired mightily to see him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When one will see
        Jesus, even to this hour, his desire is granted to him. So then these
        Gentiles presently set their longing eyes upon the man they sought.
        And Jesus, looking with prophetic gaze adown the vista of coming
        centuries, saw in these foreigners, with their clear, fair faces and
        candid eyes, those who should truly accept him as their king,
        understanding as the Jews could not the glories of his invisible
        kingdom. And seeing thus all that must be, he said to those about
        him: <span class="tei tei-q">“The hour is come that the Son of man
        should be glorified.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And again he said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth
        and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much
        fruit. He that loveth his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg
        96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life
        loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it
        unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where
        I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will
        the Father honor. Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
        Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this
        hour. Father, glorify thy name.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came a great
        Voice out of the unseen. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have both
        glorified it, and will glorify it again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people heard
        the sound of the Voice and trembled. But not to every man is it given
        to hear aright; so some said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It
        thundered,”</span> and rolled foolish eyes toward the cloudless
        heavens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others,
        awe-stricken, whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“An angel hath
        spoken to him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these Jesus
        spake presently. <span class="tei tei-q">“This <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>voice hath not come for my sake, but for
        your sakes. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince
        of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
        will draw all men unto me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then one of the
        scribes, shaken out of his hypocrisy by the thunder of that celestial
        Voice, asked in all sincerity: <span class="tei tei-q">“We have heard
        out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou,
        The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Jesus,
        divinely patient, answered once again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet a
        little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light,
        that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness
        knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have the light, believe on the
        light, that ye may become sons of light.”</span></p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And with that word
        he went away and hid himself, and no man saw him for many hours.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stronger even than
        the cords of love are the cords of habit. If a man has shaken a
        brazen cup and bellowed for alms for more than a score of years, the
        cup and the cry will have become a part of himself, not lightly to be
        shaken off. Chelluh, with eyes, hungered as before, and as before he
        coveted money for his few and evil pleasures. So it came to pass that
        after a day spent in sight-seeing, he was again squatting comfortably
        in his familiar corner by the Damascus gate, his eyes closed, his
        horny knuckles beating a monotonous accompaniment to the familiar
        mendicant’s <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg
        100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>whine: <span class="tei tei-q">“Have mercy, kind
        lords of Jerusalem! Have mercy on the sorrows of one born blind! Kind
        lords, beautiful ladies, only a denarius, I beseech of
        you!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor, searching
        anxiously for his new Master in every corner of the city, came upon
        the beggar unawares, and stopped short in indignant amaze.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Did not the King, my Master, give thee sight
        but yesterday?”</span> he demanded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chelluh opened his
        eyes with a muttered malediction. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who art
        thou,”</span> he snarled, <span class="tei tei-q">“to question me?
        How else shall I live?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor looked hard at
        the man’s great bulk. <span class="tei tei-q">“There are many
        laborers working in the great quarries yonder,”</span> he answered
        slowly. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Romans pay every man of them a
        silver penny.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chelluh replied to
        this suggestion with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
        101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
        string of curses spoken in three languages. He ended by hurling a
        great stone at the lad’s head. Badly aimed, the missile crashed over
        the wall of a garden hard by.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a moment
        of silence, during which Chelluh scuttled rapidly away. Then a small
        door in the wall was suddenly thrown open and two men darted out.
        They looked up and down the narrow street, and seeing no one but Tor,
        who stood staring in stupefied silence after the beggar, they seized
        the boy and dragged him into the enclosure, locking and barring the
        door behind them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis an evil offspring of beggars that hath done this
        mischief,”</span> exclaimed one of the men angrily. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Did I not say it?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other man
        fixed his eyes on Tor. <span class="tei tei-q">“Didst thou throw the
        stone that broke the great vase yonder?”</span> he
        asked.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg
        102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor’s wild, bright
        eyes followed the man’s accusing finger to the spot where an urn
        carven from costly marble lay in ruins amid a tangle of bright
        flowers. <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not throw the stone,”</span>
        he said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lies!”</span> cried the first man, stamping his foot.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why question a dog? Give the fellow to me; I
        will scourge him soundly and thrust him forth. His bleeding back
        will, perchance, warn others of his sort to keep their distance from
        the palace.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am not a dog,”</span> said Tor boldly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am the servant of a King. I was looking for my Master,
        and another hurled the stone at me. But because the man was lately
        healed of blindness he could not throw a stone with ease, and,
        therefore, it came over the wall.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the men
        shook with laughter at this speech. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, but
        thou art a pretty <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg
        103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>liar,”</span> he said at last. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The servant of a King! aye, thou dost look the part
        rarely! May I ask thee the name of thy royal Master?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His name is Jesus,”</span> said Tor. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I was blind, and he gave me eyes. Therefore, I serve
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faces of both
        men had grown suddenly serious. They exchanged significant glances.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Better hold the boy till my lord’s return;
        he will, perchance, wish to question him of the matter,”</span> said
        one. And the other nodding, gripped the child roughly by the
        shoulder, and presently thrust him into an empty scullery of an inner
        court.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor flung himself
        against the heavy door in a sudden fury of despair. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let me out!”</span> he screamed. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let me out! I must find my Master.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, as no one
        paid the slightest heed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
        104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        his outcries, he began to look about him for some means of escape.
        The one window high in the wall was heavily barred, and there was no
        opening in the small, dark chamber save the door by which he had
        entered, and this was fast locked on the outside.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boy tore at
        his rags like a trapped animal. Then spying a great sealed jar in one
        corner he began to scratch savagely at its cover. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If it be wine,”</span> he muttered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will drink my fill for once. Nay, I will do more. I
        will spill upon the earth all that I cannot drink. I hate the men who
        have thrust me into this place! Also, I hate Chelluh; some day I will
        kill him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your
        Father may forgive you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who had spoken?
        The beggar child <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
        105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>ceased his beast-like clawing at the sealed lid
        of the jar; his flushed face paled slowly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Forgive—forgive!”</span> The words rang clearly in his
        bewildered ears. He sank slowly to the floor, and dropped his head to
        his lean knees in an effort to remember. <span class="tei tei-q">“It
        was my Master who said it,”</span> he muttered at last. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He said <span class="tei tei-q">‘Forgive, that your
        Father may forgive.’</span> Father—my Father!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child’s face
        lighted with sudden joy. <span class="tei tei-q">“He said whosoever
        asks shall have. I will ask, for I want to get out of this place that
        I may follow my Master.”</span> Then in a loud, clear voice, after
        the fashion of the Pharisees he had heard praying in the temple and
        on the corners of the streets, he cried aloud: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Father, I want to get out of this place! My Father! I
        want to get out—Father! Father!”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a soft
        fumbling sound at the door. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is
        calling?”</span> asked a sweet, imperious voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am calling,”</span> answered Tor expectantly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I want to get out.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can’t unlock the door,”</span> answered the voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but Oonah can. Be quiet till I fetch
        her.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A moment later the
        sunshine streamed in through the open door, revealing the figure of a
        very beautiful child on its threshold. Behind the child stood a young
        girl attired like a servant. She was smiling broadly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How didst thou come in here, boy?”</span> she asked,
        staring curiously at the beggar’s tear-stained face and scant
        rags.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The fat man with the red tunic put me here,”</span> said
        Tor. <span class="tei tei-q">“He said I broke the vase with a stone,
        but I did not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It was Marcus who shut him up,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said the maid, pursing up her lips
        knowingly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I must shut him in again, and
        make fast the door before Marcus finds out that I have opened it.
        Come, princess, we—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Be silent, Oonah, I wish to speak to the boy,”</span>
        said the child with a gesture of command. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Where is thy father?”</span> she continued, fixing her
        blue eyes on Tor. <span class="tei tei-q">“I heard thee calling him.
        I thought it was Set, the slave boy; he is always getting into
        trouble.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor pointed upward
        vaguely. <span class="tei tei-q">“I called my Father who is in
        heaven,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have not seen
        him, but he causes what one asks to be done; my Master said
        it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who said it?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My Master. His Name is Jesus. He is a King. He made me
        see. I was blind.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou wast blind?”</span> cried the serving-<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>maid, laughing incredulously. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, but thine eyes are bright as stars.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They were not bright,”</span> said Tor soberly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“They were smitten into darkness. The Roman
        did it with his chariot-whip. But the King, my Master, touched them.
        So I see. I must find him. I pray thee let me go!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let him go,”</span> said the child imperiously.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost thou hear me, Oonah? And, stay, I will
        give the boy my gold bracelet that father gave me yesterday. Nay, I
        have said it!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The maid clasped
        her hands. <span class="tei tei-q">“But, princess,”</span> she
        entreated, <span class="tei tei-q">“what would the honorable lady,
        thy mother, do with me if the bracelet be missing? And to a beggar
        lad—for thou seest that he is nothing more. The boy would be scourged
        or stoned if found with such a jewel in his
        hand.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg
        109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child glanced
        doubtfully at Tor from under the curling gold of her hair.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall I give thee, boy?”</span> she
        asked. <span class="tei tei-q">“For I will give thee something; thou
        hast amused me, and Oonah here is so stupid. I am quite weary of
        her.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am hungry,”</span> said Tor promptly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Also, I am thirsty. Also, I want to get out of this
        place.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The little
        princess burst into a silvery laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come
        with me,”</span> she said imperiously. And, before the maid could
        stop her, she seized the beggar child by the hand and drew him away
        up the steps of a marble terrace. Oonah followed in terrified
        silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beneath the shadow
        of a silken canopy, on a couch of ivory and silver cushioned with
        rose-colored damask reclined a lady. The most beautiful lady, thought
        Tor, that the sun ever shone upon. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>beggar’s brilliant eyes sparkled with amazement
        and pleasure; his white teeth glimmered through his scarlet lips in
        an innocent smile, which faded before the look of haughty displeasure
        on the lady’s fair face.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is this, Felicia?”</span> she demanded, raising her
        head from the pillow to a white hand loaded with gems.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, my worshipful lady,”</span> began Oonah, trembling
        under the cold, questioning eyes which were bent upon her.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I beseech of thee to listen to me, while
        I—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Be silent, Oonah,”</span> said Felicia, stamping her
        small foot. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will explain. I was trying to
        amuse myself in the gardens, as usual, with this foolish
        Oonah,”</span> she went on rapidly, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I
        heard some one call. It was this boy. That ugly, meddlesome Marcus
        had shut <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg
        111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him
        into the cellar without food or drink. He has done nothing at all,
        and more than that he is the servant of a King. I wished to give him
        my bracelet and let him go. But Oonah disputed the matter with me, as
        I have forbidden her to do. May I not do as I will with my
        own?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Stay, my child, I will call Marcus,”</span> said the
        lady, smiling. <span class="tei tei-q">“He will explain.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, he shall not interfere,”</span> cried the spoiled
        child. <span class="tei tei-q">“The boy hath amused me, and Marcus
        shall not have him. Heigho! this Jerusalem is so dull. I am weary of
        it.”</span> The child threw back her head with an exaggerated gesture
        of lassitude which brought another smile to the lady’s lips.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How hath the boy amused thee, little one?”</span> she
        asked languidly. <span class="tei tei-q">“If there is <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>anything diverting about this place I
        would fain hear of it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The boy was blind, mother, and the King, his Master,
        touched his eyes and they became bright, as thou seest them. Is not
        that an amusing story?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What King in Jerusalem can heal blind eyes?”</span>
        asked the lady, turning with some curiosity to Tor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His name is Jesus,”</span> said Tor simply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady drew her
        delicate brows together. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have heard of the
        man,”</span> she said coldly. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is arousing
        sedition among the turbulent Jews, as hath many a one before him. He
        will shortly be dealt with after his kind, I doubt not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He will not be hurt,”</span> said Tor positively.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My Father will not permit anything to befall
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        strong curses that blight like a flame. But now I have forgiven him,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor was

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dog, Baladan,
        led a lonely life in these days. Confined to his own little quarter
        of Jerusalem by that unwritten yet inexorable law which prevails to
        this day among the half wild street dogs of oriental cities, he dared
        not follow his adopted master beyond the corner of the short, dark
        street which was his chosen haunt. After some mysterious fashion the
        dog was aware that should he venture alone into the streets and
        squares beyond he would be instantly torn in pieces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">’Tis seldom that
        an animal of the pariah breed shows the least regard or <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>affection for men. But Tor was so like a
        little animal himself that the heart of the great, gaunt beast had
        gone out to him. And Tor responded in kind. The undivided love of a
        beast is better than no love at all. Perhaps it is because of this
        that the heart of a dog is so loving; more than once has it solaced
        pain that would otherwise be unbearable in the nobler heart of a
        child.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baladan was
        licking with anxious care a fragment of leather once worn by his
        little master. This done, he laid his ugly head upon it, and dreamed
        a vague dream of delight in which one figure—the figure of Tor—moved
        always before him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly he sprang
        up, his rough coat bristling, and listened, then with a whine of
        delight bounded forward and flung himself upon the small, half-naked
        figure <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name=
        "Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that was stealing along
        in the shadow of the high walls.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor was breathing
        fast and his puny chest heaved with an occasional strangling sob as
        he flung himself down by the dog. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,
        Baladan,”</span> he whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I can’t find
        him; what shall I do?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baladan covered
        the child’s feet with warm, wet kisses, his great yellow-brown eyes
        brimming over with tears of anxious affection. He moaned and gurgled
        and laid one hard paw on his master’s knee in token of his utter
        allegiance. Tor wound his thin arms about the dog’s neck, and buried
        his face in the scanty yellow fur. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us
        sleep, Baladan,”</span> he said drowsily, after a time. And the two
        curled themselves in their old haunt under the dark archway and
        presently dreamed and slept.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sound of
        voices lowered to a hissing whisper suddenly aroused the child. He
        touched the dog warningly, and listened. A name had been spoken—the
        name of his Master—he was sure of it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Listen. This man, Jesus, who has so taken thy living from thee, is
        either a God or a false prophet—may Jehovah help me, but I know not
        what he is! The priests and Pharisees hate him. The people are
        divided. He must declare himself either one way or the other. I have
        sworn that I will force him to it. And I have sworn further to
        deliver him into the hands of the priests without tumult. I have
        watched thee and thou art a tool fitted to my hand. Go thou among
        those of thine own sort and arouse them against the man. Thou canst
        do it. Thou hast a nimble tongue, and the rabble will hear

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What if he be a God,”</span> demanded Chelluh, with a
        gesture of fear. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, I will have none of
        it. He opened mine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg

        my hand against such a man.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But if he be a God,”</span> said the other eagerly,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he will make it known rather than die like a
        criminal. Hark you, they will stone him, or crucify him, if they are
        able.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am afraid of the man,”</span> growled Chelluh.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And who art thou to do this thing! I am no
        whining Levite; but thou—art verily a devil.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am a patriot,”</span> declared the other boldly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I know the man well. He professes to be
        Messiah. If he is the true Deliverer not a hair of his head shall be
        hurt; if not, let him die the death. I have sworn it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then was a short
        silence broken by the musical chink of silver. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is naught to fear from Jesus of Nazareth,”</span>
        said the voice of the man who had de<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>clared himself a patriot. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He would render to no man evil for evil. I have heard
        him say it many times, and I know that he is true. He loves his
        enemies and forgives every one who offends—not once only, but seventy
        times seven. If he prove to be Messiah I shall confess my plans and
        my thoughts to him, and he will forgive me readily. I shall then be a
        great prince and potentate in the new kingdom. This paltry sum shall
        be multiplied to thee thrice over.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will do it,”</span> said Chelluh, shaking the silver
        pieces in his hard palms till they chinked again. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And I also will be forgiven, after I have worked my will
        with the man and with the multitude.”</span> The beggar laughed
        aloud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor shuddered at
        the evil sound as he lay quiet in his lair. After that the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122"
        id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>silence remained unbroken, and
        the child at length ventured to peep out from the archway. The two
        men were just emerging into the brightly-lighted square beyond, and
        the sun falling full upon the face of Chelluh’s companion revealed it
        as the face of Judas. Tor flung his arms about the neck of the dog.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, Baladan,”</span> he whispered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I must find my Master. If I were only a
        great man with a great sword how I would fight for him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the boy
        remained where he was for another hour till the sun had sunken behind
        the mountains. Then, emerging into the twilight of the narrow street,
        he trotted noiselessly away. Baladan followed at his heels like a
        shadow, and like a shadow refused to be left behind at the accustomed
        boundary. Some vague stirring in the dog’s loving heart <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>told him that his master was going into
        danger, and forthwith his own imminent peril was forgotten.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To his unbounded
        joy, Tor saw not many rods distant the figure of Peter, the Galilean,
        walking swiftly along with bent head. He ran to him and, placing
        himself directly in the man’s way, bowed himself humbly before him.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I beseech thee to listen to me, honorable
        Galilean,”</span> he began, <span class="tei tei-q">“for I have evil
        tidings which concern my Master.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dog whined
        uneasily, and flattened his lean body against the stones. The man’s
        angry eyes cut him like a lash.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Out of my way, companion of a pariah,”</span> said the
        Galilean, with profound disgust. <span class="tei tei-q">“What hast
        thou to do with the Master?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He strode forward,
        shaking off with a shudder of loathing the small imploring
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124"
        id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hand of the beggar child.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“They will kill him,”</span> cried Tor.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The man said so. They hate him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dog sprang
        forward with a low growl of anger and fastened his white teeth in the
        garments of the fisherman. That wail of anguish in his master’s voice
        had roused him to a frenzy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Galilean
        raised his stout oaken staff and smote the animal twice—thrice with
        all his strength. The gaunt body quivered, dropped, rolled over once,
        and was still.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jew hurried
        away, breathing deep in his anger and disgust. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am defiled,”</span> he muttered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for the breath of an unclean beast hath polluted my
        garments.”</span> He glanced back over his shoulder and beheld the
        beggar kneeling by the body of the dog. And his indig<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nation found vent in deep-mouthed,
        muttered curses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That same night
        the passover was sacrificed, and all Jerusalem feasted with solemn
        rites and decorous rejoicings. But Tor crouched on the stones outside
        one of the low, dark houses within the third wall of the city. He had
        followed the Galilean afar off, had seen him at length with his
        Master and the eleven enter this house. The child drowsed between
        whiles as the hours passed, and the white moon looked down at him
        between the houses. He had forgiven Peter, the Galilean, for the
        death of Baladan, even as his Master had commanded, and that singular
        peace which the world neither gives nor takes away filled his
        soul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He could have told
        no man why he was so strangely content, when, in the old <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>days, fury would have scorched him. For
        the moment he had forgotten the evil words of Chelluh and the
        disciple called Judas; and, remembering them, he murmured a simple
        prayer to the mysterious, unseen Father, in whom he was coming to
        believe with all the strength of his childish being. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Our Father will take care of my Master,”</span> he said
        aloud, and smiled alone in the darkness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within the house,
        in a large upper chamber, Jesus sat at his last meal upon earth with
        the few whom he had chosen, knowing all things that should shortly
        come to pass, and understanding to the full the pitiful ignorance and
        darkness in the hearts of the disciples.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again they
        disputed among themselves as to which of them should be accounted
        greatest in that coming kingdom of glory which the Master now told
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127"
        id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them plainly had been appointed
        unto him. To sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of
        Israel was, indeed, a glorious future; they accepted the idea with
        complaisance, but one must be greater than his fellows in any
        kingdom, and each of them coveted the supreme crown of power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Jesus,
        knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that
        he came forth from God, and was going to God, arose from supper, and
        laying aside his garments, took a basin and began to wash the
        disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
        girded. And so he came in turn to Peter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter said to him,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, thou shalt never wash my
        feet.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with
        me.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
        128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lord, not my feet only,”</span> said Peter, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but my hands and my head.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came that
        dark moment when the man called Judas received the morsel of bread
        dipped in wine. <span class="tei tei-q">“What thou doest, do
        quickly,”</span> said the Master, with a look of full understanding
        which penetrated the dismal labyrinth of the man’s soul like a flash
        of blinding light.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas ran
        violently out of the house, and the darkness swallowed him. He knew
        himself at last. He was no eager patriot, no doubting disciple,
        anxious to force a triumphant issue. He ground his teeth in a very
        fury of rage and hatred, as he sped on his terrible mission.</p>

        drowsing on the cold stones without, shuddered at sound of that
        ominous, hurrying footfall. <span class="tei tei-q">“My Father will

        slept.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within that
        dimly-lighted upper chamber the compassionate Master was trying to
        prepare the little company of unsuspecting disciples for the darker
        hours just before them. <span class="tei tei-q">“All ye shall be
        offended because of me this night,”</span> he said sorrowfully.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“For it is written, I will smite the

        after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter answered in

        be offended, yet will not I.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus said to him,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Galilean

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The primal
        instinct which has ever led man to the kind bosom of earth in his
        darkest hour led the man Christ Jesus to Gethsemane. And there under
        the dense shadow of the ancient olives he threw himself down upon the
        ground for that last exceeding bitter struggle with his humanity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Peter, the
        Galilean, and the others—slept.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor had followed
        them, noiseless and unseen as a friendly shadow. He did not approach
        the King, his Master, nor did he again venture to accost Peter.
        Squatting motionless at the gate of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>garden, the child thought confusedly but
        joyfully of his deliverance from the house of Pilate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It was because I prayed to my Father,”</span> he told
        himself, and hugged his lean little body with a low laugh of
        pleasure. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hereafter I need fear nothing. I
        will call and he will deliver me, and neither man nor demon can
        hinder.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His soul went out
        in a flood of love toward the Man who had opened his eyes, and who
        was at that moment lying upon his face under the olives in a wordless
        agony, and the child’s pure thoughts mingled with the cloudy forms of
        angels which comforted him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somewhere, afar
        off, lights gleamed among the dark trees; stealthy footfalls and
        hushed voices beyond the garden wall reached the boy’s keen ears. He
        sprang up and listened intently.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The glare of
        smoking torches and the irregular tread of hurrying feet sent
        vibrations of horror through the shuddering night. But the Man of
        Nazareth no longer lay upon his face amid the shadows. He came forth
        to receive the brimming cup of his sorrows radiant with the power
        that had never failed him. Stooping over his sleeping disciples he
        called them: <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, let us be going: behold,
        he that betrayeth me is at hand.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now Judas had
        before agreed with the officers that he would greet his Master with a
        kiss. <span class="tei tei-q">“So that ye may know the man from his
        disciples,—stupid dolts every one and not worth the
        taking.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the motley
        crowd of temple police, bearing torches, followed by a rabble of the
        curious, advanced into the gloom of the garden a superstitious awe
        fell upon them. They drew back to a man and <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>hesitated, casting fearful glances at the dark
        masses of trees moving gently in the night wind. Some unseen,
        noiseless terror seemed to lurk amid the shifting shadows.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If the man be a prophet,”</span> whispered
        one, <span class="tei tei-q">“there be blasting lightnings at his
        call. Let us go back.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Judas turned
        his sneering face upon the speaker with a low laugh of scorn.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Master! Master!”</span> he cried mockingly,
        and running forward he clasped and kissed the Saviour of the
        world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus said to him,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a
        kiss?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lord, shall we smite with the sword?”</span> cried one
        of the disciples.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not waiting for an
        answer, Peter drew his weapon and aimed a mighty blow at the officer
        nearest him. The man fell back with a bellow of rage and pain,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134"
        id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>while his companions sprang
        forward and seized Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eyes of the
        prisoner, grave, calm, and compassionate, were fixed upon the wounded
        man, from whose severed ear blood spurted in a torrent. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Permit me thus far,”</span> he said gently to the
        officers who grasped him by the arms, and reaching forth he touched
        the ear and healed it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then that
        omniscient gaze turned full upon Peter, who stood staring in a frozen
        stupor at the being he had believed to be the invincible Messiah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Put up again thy sword into its place,”</span> said the
        Master; <span class="tei tei-q">“for all they that take the sword
        shall perish with the sword.”</span> Then, answering further the
        thoughts that looked out of the bewildered, terror-stricken eyes of
        the man whom he had named <span class="tei tei-q">“The Rock,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135"
        id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and
        he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But
        how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must
        be?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he uttered no
        prayer to his Father, and the ranks of the angelic host remained hid
        from the expectant eyes that searched the empty heavens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In that same hour
        Jesus said to the multitude which gathered about him, threatening,
        yet awe-stricken by the miracle, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are ye come
        out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? When I was daily
        with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but
        this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that word the
        darkness closed in about him—and it was night.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the courtyard
        of the high priest’s house Tor lurked in the shelter of a doorway and
        looked on. No one had noticed the child as he slipped in with the
        crowd that held at its core the silent Man of Nazareth. Peter had
        also followed. Tor watched the Galilean seat himself with the others
        at a small fire which was kindled in the midst of the place. He had
        turned his back upon the travesty of a legal examination which was
        going on at the upper end of the hall and was warming his fingers
        with an air of complete indifference.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So the dangerous prophet is proven but a man of straw,
        after all,”</span> quoth one of the lesser officers of the police
        with a contemptuous gesture toward the meek figure of the Nazarene.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Look you upon the fellow now, he hath never
        a word to say for himself, and there are <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>no lightnings—no thunders. By the seven-branched
        candlestick, I declare to you that I was in a cold sweat when I laid
        hands on the man. But I felt nothing more terrible than an arm of
        flesh and blood under his rabbi’s robe.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A rabbi’s robe, indeed,”</span> chuckled another.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He will wear another sort before many days,
        I promise you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But what sayest thou to the healing of Ben-Joseph’s
        ear?”</span> demanded a woman who had approached the fire.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have just talked with the son of Joseph.
        He declares that from henceforth he is a believer.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A great shout of
        laughter greeted this speech. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ben-Joseph
        hath ever a nimble tongue,”</span> quoth a black-bearded young fellow
        who carried a short sword stuck in his belt. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A nimble tongue, say I, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and the long ears of an ass. One of the
        Galileans made a lunge at him, but, being a clumsy knave of a
        fisherman and knowing naught of the uses of a sword, he merely grazed
        the ear.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, fellow, the ear was sliced clean off,”</span>
        growled Peter, stung to retort by the sneering words of the
        Judean.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The woman bent
        forward to stare at the speaker. <span class="tei tei-q">“Art not
        thou also one of the man’s disciples?”</span> she asked
        curiously.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am not,”</span> said Peter shortly. He was listening
        painfully to his Master’s voice in low-toned response to a question
        of the high priest. At sound of a violent, flat-handed blow, he
        twisted quite about in his place and beheld the colorless face of
        Jesus slowly reddening under the insult. <span class="tei tei-q">“If
        I have spoken evil,”</span> he was saying in a low, clear voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“bear wit<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>ness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou
        me?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Galilean rose
        from his place at the fire, breathing deep, his strong hands clenched
        at his sides in futile anger. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why doth he
        not blast them with the word of his power?”</span> he asked himself
        as he stealthily watched the terrible mockery of justice which was
        now drawing to its close.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were
        questioning the prisoner sharply now. Peter could see the dark looks
        of satisfaction on the faces of the priests and Sanhedrists and the
        sneering laughter of the rabble at their back. Then came a show of
        witnesses against the prisoner. Among the witnesses stood Chelluh,
        the beggar who had once been blind. <span class="tei tei-q">“The man
        healed me of blindness—yes, it is so, most worshipful lords,”</span>
        he whined. <span class="tei tei-q">“’Twas accom<span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>plished by black magic and the power of
        Beelzebub, I declare to you, for he who would lightly destroy the
        temple of God must needs be of the devil.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What sayest thou of the temple, fellow?”</span> demanded
        the high priest. <span class="tei tei-q">“Did the man dare to
        threaten the temple?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Most holy and reverend high priest,”</span> replied
        Chelluh, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Nazarene said in my hearing,
        and in the hearing of this friend of mine—an honest craftsman, as
        thou seest—<span class="tei tei-q">‘I am able to destroy the temple
        of God, and to build it in three days!’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The high priest
        arose in his place and fixed his eyes upon the prisoner. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Answerest thou nothing?”</span> he hissed between set
        teeth. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the meaning of this saying
        which these reputable witnesses bring against
        thee?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
        141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus seemed not
        to have heard the question. His inscrutable eyes were bent upon the
        ground; upon his face shone a faint, mysterious light. The high
        priest bent forward and stared at him, unrelentingly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
        us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God!</span></span>”</span>
        he cried in a terrible voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Man of
        Nazareth lifted his meek head at that word. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am,”</span> he said slowly—distinctly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right
        hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He hath spoken blasphemy!”</span> exclaimed the high
        priest, rending his garments with a gesture of outraged holiness.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What further need have we of witnesses? Ye
        have heard the blasphemy: what think ye?”</span></p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Death—death! He is guilty!”</span> came the
        deep-throated answer of the priests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cries of triumph,
        dreadful laughter, the sound of buffeting palms burst forth from
        judges and witnesses alike. Some one was tying a handkerchief over
        the face of the prisoner with the mocking words, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Behold the Prophet!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Prophesy unto us, thou Christ. Who is he that smote
        thee?”</span> yelled the savage voice of the beggar who had received
        his sight; and he smote his blinded Saviour with open palms
        twice—thrice—many times.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A suffocating mist
        rolled blood-red before the eyes of Peter. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If he were the Messiah,”</span> he groaned, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“this could not be. The man hath mocked and deceived us
        from the beginning!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somewhere, not far
        away, sounded the cheerful crowing of a cock. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will go <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
        143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>back
        to Galilee,”</span> he muttered. But his leaden feet carried him no
        farther from the awful scene than the porch. Here he loitered,
        listening with a frightful, strained attention to the sounds of
        ribaldry and laughter that came out to him through the half-open
        doors. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will go,”</span> he said aloud.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I must go. It is already day.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The servants of
        the high priest’s household were astir and cheerfully busy with their
        morning tasks. One of them, a buxom maid bearing a jar upon her head,
        paused and stared attentively at the Galilean. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aha!”</span> she exclaimed. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This man also was with Jesus, the Nazarene.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter raised his
        heavy eyes to the fresh-colored, inquisitive face of the woman.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I know not the man,”</span> he snarled with
        an oath. The woman went <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
        144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her
        way with a laughing gesture of unbelief.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then others of the
        bystanders began to cast curious glances at the haggard face and wild
        eyes of the stranger. They whispered among themselves for a space,
        then a man wearing the livery of the house of Annas advanced with an
        air of determination. <span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly, thou art
        one of them,”</span> he said authoritatively, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for thou art a Galilean.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter turned upon
        the man with a torrent of angry oaths. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        tell thee, fellow,”</span> he cried loudly, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that I know not this man of whom thou
        speakest.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cock crew for
        the second time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great doors of
        the judgment-hall were flung wide, and the motley throng of priests
        and underlings, glutted with their awful triumph, pushed through,
        dragging the piteous figure of their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        and calm amid the dark looks of his persecutors; his loving eyes
        turned for the last time upon Peter and flashed into his darkened
        soul the remembrance of that sad word of prophecy: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me
        thrice.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Peter went out

        <span style="font-size: 173%">IN THE PALACE GARDEN</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wife of Pilate
        arose from her couch with a troubled and haggard look on her fair
        face. The maid who attended the great lady’s toilet observed this
        with curiosity. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is tumult about the
        gates of the palace this morning,”</span> she said, as she combed out
        the long blonde tresses with a comb of gold and ivory, preparatory to
        weaving them into a graceful crown of braided strands.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The princess
        shrugged her fair shoulders with a slight gesture of weariness.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“There is always tumult,”</span> she said
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147"
        id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>languidly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah me, ’tis a dreary place—this Jerusalem. I would I
        were once more safely at Rome.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If my noble lady will but glance into the mirror, she
        will behold a fairer sight than even Rome can offer,”</span> said the
        maid obsequiously, and skilfully fastened a fresh-blown rose so that
        its crimson petals rested on the white neck of her mistress.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But the tumult of this morning differs from
        that of other days, honorable princess,”</span> she went on eagerly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Diomed says that the Jews have seized their
        prophet and are about to put him to death—if, indeed, they are
        allowed.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What prophet, girl?”</span> demanded the lady, a faint
        flush stealing into her pale cheeks. <span class="tei tei-q">“Every
        man is a prophet—or a priest, is it not so, in this hateful
        Jerusalem? And the prophets have loud <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        tumult.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I myself have seen this man,”</span> said the girl.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He is quite unlike the other rabbis, as they
        call them—of a gentle voice, and a stature majestic. I bethought me
        of my gods in Athens. Yet is the man a Jew.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His name?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His name is Jesus; also they call him the
        Nazarene.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The princess
        uttered a faint exclamation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pardon me, I beseech thee, honorable mistress, if I have
        fastened that last plait too tightly,”</span> hastily interposed the
        maid, withdrawing a jeweled pin from its place and readjusting it
        with elaborate care.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Didst thou say they were bringing the Nazarene here—to

        149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class=

        upon her servant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Honorable lady, the man is already here, and my lord,
        the governor, is attending the case without upon the seat of
        judgment. The Jews refused to await the proper hour, and my lord
        Pilate, with his wonted indulgence, came forth to them. These
        barbarians have no hearts, noble lady, they are without consideration
        for the sleep of an illustrious Roman. They should be scourged as
        slaves.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What will they do with him?”</span> muttered the wife of
        Pilate, clenching her white hands. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, my
        lord should have nought to do with this prophet. He must dismiss the
        case.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The maid stared at
        her mistress in some perplexity. <span class="tei tei-q">“The morning
        is warm and fair,”</span> she said at last. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg
        150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it
        please your highness to breakfast upon the terrace? The lady Felicia
        is already playing in the garden of the inner court.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the secluded
        spot where slaves had spread a table with the breakfast-service of
        the princess, the morning sun struck sparks of splendor from
        burnished plates and crystal, gem-rimmed goblets. Flowers of every
        delicate color and odor, violets from Gethsemane, lilies from the
        deep vale of Kedron, roses from the nearer gardens of the palace,
        heaped a golden bowl in the center, while around it glowed the richer
        hues of fruit, brought from distant parts of the country, and flagons
        of delicate wine, cooling in beds of snow fetched from the crown of
        Lebanon for this spoiled daughter of Rome.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady cast a
        dissatisfied glance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg
        151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>about the garden. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where
        is Felicia?”</span> she asked sharply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She was here but a moment ago, noble lady,”</span>
        replied the maid, who had followed her mistress with a fan of
        peacock’s feathers and an armful of embroidered pillows. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will call Oonah.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But neither Oonah
        nor the child were anywhere to be found, and after a little the
        princess began her repast with frowning brows. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is too much noise about the place,”</span> she
        observed in a displeased tone, as she tasted a silver fig smothered
        in wine and spices.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The servants
        glanced at one another with lifted brows. <span class="tei tei-q">“It
        cannot be helped, honorable mistress,”</span> ventured one of them, a
        young Greek lad, beautiful as a creation of Praxitiles in his short
        tunic bordered with blue. <span class="tei tei-q">“All the
        loud-mouthed Jews of the city, it would seem, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>headed by their priests, are surrounding
        the judgment-seat before the palace. The guard would not have
        admitted them; but my lord, the governor, ordered it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He could not do otherwise,”</span> said the lady, with a
        slight curl of her haughty lip. <span class="tei tei-q">“But what is
        it that they are saying over and again? ’Tis a horrid sound, like the
        cry of wolves hungering after their prey.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again the servants
        exchanged half-frightened glances, and again the beautiful young
        Greek answered his lady. <span class="tei tei-q">“’Tis a custom in
        this Jerusalem for the governor to release a prisoner at feast
        time,”</span> he said in a low voice. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perchance, the people are demanding this pledge from the
        illustrious Pilate.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady’s face
        cleared. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, it is so,”</span> she cried;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I remember how it befell last year. My lord
        will release to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
        153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them
        the Nazarene, who is called Jesus. Is it not so, Diomed?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek
        hesitated, and in the moment of silence the child, Felicia, closely
        followed by her nurse, rushed into the garden. Her golden hair was
        disordered, and her blue eyes reddened with angry tears. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They shall not scourge the boy!”</span> she cried,
        stamping her small foot. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have said it; but
        that stupid, wicked Marcus declares that he will do it. Wilt thou not
        send for him, mother, and cause him to be punished for disobeying
        me?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The princess
        turned her eyes severely upon Oonah. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where
        hath the child been, and what is all this about Marcus? What has
        happened?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oonah trembled
        under the cold looks of her mistress. <span class="tei tei-q">“’Tis
        the beggar boy again,”</span> she faltered. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He was beating <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
        154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>upon
        the door of the outer court like a mad thing, and demanding speech
        with your highness. But, of course, Marcus—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Marcus is a beast—an animal!”</span> again interrupted
        Felicia passionately. <span class="tei tei-q">“Listen to me,
        princess, I can explain everything far better than this stupid Oonah.
        Dost thou not remember the beggar lad whose eyes were restored by a
        King named Jesus? I brought him to this very spot two—three days ago.
        The boy amused me with his story. But Oonah thrust him forth
        because—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I remember,”</span> said the wife of Pilate with a
        strange look. <span class="tei tei-q">“What then?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The mob wish to kill his Master, the King, and the lad
        came hither to beg his life. Marcus was about to scourge him and
        thrust him forth, but I forbade it. I say he shall not harm the boy.
        Do thou <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name=
        "Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>command it also, my
        mother—and quickly, for Marcus will not obey me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fetch the lad to me, Diomed,”</span> ordered the lady
        briefly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young Greek
        obeyed, and presently returned to the presence of his mistress
        followed by the irate porter, his big hand buried in the rough curls
        of the beggar’s head. Tor presented a pitiable appearance, his pallid
        face streaked with tears and dust, his great eyes wide with fear and
        horror.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sight of the
        princess the child fell sobbing to his knees and lifted his lean arms
        in an agony of petition. <span class="tei tei-q">“My Master—my
        Master!”</span> he wailed. And again, <span class="tei tei-q">“My
        Master, oh, my Master!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wife of Pilate
        signed to Marcus to release the boy, then she ordered Diomed to give
        him wine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor obediently
        swallowed from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg
        156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cup
        which was held to his lips; but not once did he remove his beseeching
        eyes from the beautiful haughty face of the princess. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou canst save him,”</span> he whispered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady shook her
        head. <span class="tei tei-q">“I fear that I cannot,”</span> she
        said. Then to the astonishment of every one present she laid her
        delicate hand on the beggar’s rough head. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tell me why thou dost love this man—this
        Nazarene?”</span> she asked softly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, do
        not weep and tremble so, child. I will do all that I can to save
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor choked back
        his tears and gazed steadfastly into the exquisite troubled face
        which leaned toward him. <span class="tei tei-q">“I love him—because
        he loves—me,”</span> he faltered. <span class="tei tei-q">“He opened
        my eyes. He is good. He is the King—my Master. I love
        him.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
        157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why do the Jews hate him so?”</span> murmured the lady.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“In my dream I saw him—as one altogether
        lovely, enthroned high above all the gods of Rome and Greece. Then I
        saw—”</span> She broke off with a shudder. The wild tumult of voices
        in the square without had risen into an awful, insistent iteration of
        one terrible phrase.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What do they say now?”</span> she demanded with
        slowly-whitening face, turning to Diomed, who watched the scene with
        a satirical curl of his handsome lips.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They are demanding the crucifixion of some criminal,
        your noble highness,”</span> replied the Greek, smirking
        courtier-like. <span class="tei tei-q">“But why trouble thyself, dear
        princess, over the doings of the wild rabble? The man, Jesus, is no
        more than a Jewish peasant—a carpenter, they say. What <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>can such an one be to the fairest princess
        in—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Go, see what is passing without,”</span> ordered the
        lady, with a look which froze the insolent smile on the lips of the
        Greek. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go, and return quickly.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek
        reappeared almost immediately with a white, scared face. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The scene without beggars description, noble
        lady,”</span> he began hurriedly, answering the command in the eyes
        of his mistress. <span class="tei tei-q">“The whole city is at the
        doors demanding the crucifixion of the Nazarene. The most noble
        Pilate believes him innocent of any crime, and would save him if
        possible; but—hear the mob!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was impossible
        to hear anything else. Those awful beast-like cries penetrated the
        ears of the very slaves so that they cowered and trembled.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My tablets, Maia,”</span> whispered the wife
        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name=
        "Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Pilate. With shaking
        fingers she wrote a few words upon the wax. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Take this,”</span> she said, turning to the Greek,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and give it into the hand of Pilate
        himself—no other. Go quickly!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek drew
        back in manifest terror. <span class="tei tei-q">“What, art thou
        afraid?”</span> sneered the princess. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold,
        I will go myself. Perhaps I can save him so.”</span> She arose and
        was descending the steps of the terrace, when the child Felicia flung
        herself at her mother’s knees with a scream of terror. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do not go out into that dreadful place, mother,”</span>
        begged the child. <span class="tei tei-q">“They are horrible—those
        Jews. Stay with me!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The princess
        paused, hesitated, and finally yielded the tablets into the
        outstretched hand of Diomed. <span class=

        <span style="font-size: 173%">LOVE TRIUMPHANT</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Pilate,
        governor of Jerusalem, seated upon the ivory chair of office before
        the palace, came the message of his wife. He glanced down at it with
        some impatience, when Diomed thrust the tablets into his hand with a
        hurried word of explanation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man,”</span>
        he read, <span class="tei tei-q">“for I have suffered many things
        this day in a dream because of him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The message was
        signed and sealed with the signet of the Roman princess. Pilate’s
        pallid and heavy face whitened to the lifeless hues of the wax upon
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161"
        id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which the fateful words were
        written. Before him stood the drooping but still majestic figure of
        the Nazarene, robed in the purple robe of his torture and wearing the
        crown of thorns, a piteous sight, before which angels were vailing
        their shamed faces. Beyond the strong cordon of the Roman guard
        surged the wildest, cruelest mob of all the ages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The governor rose
        to his feet slowly, and, advancing to the side of the prisoner,
        exclaimed in his loud, passionless voice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Behold the man!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mocking laughter,
        furious incoherent shouts, coupled with the dreadful, insistent,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Crucify him! Crucify him!”</span> burst out
        in wilder clamor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pilate looked
        forth over the sea of terrible upturned eyes, and his huge limbs
        trembled beneath him. Again he glanced at the pale, melancholy face
        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name=
        "Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the prisoner.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The fellow is naught but a Jewish
        peasant,”</span> he assured himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
        after all, what use to cast Roman justice before dogs. They will have
        none of it.”</span> Loudly he called for water in a basin, and in
        sight of them all washed his hands with spectacular solemnity,
        saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am innocent of the blood of this
        just person: see ye to it!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Back came the
        mocking, inhuman cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“His blood be upon us
        and upon our children!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pilate ground his
        teeth in impotent rage, and, seizing Jesus roughly by the shoulder,
        he thrust him forward in the face of the mob. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shall I crucify your King?”</span> he shouted
        derisively.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We have no king but Cæsar!”</span> was the blasphemous
        answer. And with that word was the scroll rolled up and sealed
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163"
        id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the seven seals of wrath
        against the day of wrath.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And they took
        Jesus and led him away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On that same day
        Tor was again a prisoner. The wife of Pilate in real pity had
        commanded that the child should be comfortably entertained in the
        servants’ quarters until all should be over.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Diomed, to whom
        the carrying out of this commission was entrusted, spoke softly to
        the beggar in the presence of his mistress, bidding him follow. Out
        of sight of the lady the Greek laughed aloud in his scorn.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is a guest for our honorable
        entertainment,”</span> he said to the chief butler. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lady the princess hath commanded it. In which of the
        chambers of state shall I lodge my lord?”</span></p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The official
        sniffed his disdain. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it an
        animal?”</span> he demanded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is an animal, most sapient Clodius,”</span> laughed
        Diomed. <span class="tei tei-q">“A Jewish swine—eh?—albeit a small
        one. Give him food and wine, excellent Clodius, for he is chiefly
        bone—this animal.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor ate, for he
        was starving; also he slept fitfully, for he was exhausted with fear
        and weeping. The sun shone warm and friendly from the cloudless
        spring heavens, and the child, lying upon a rug which one of the
        slaves had flung down for him, drowsily watched the ceaseless dance
        of young grape leaves in the soft warm wind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tumult without
        had suddenly ceased, and an ominous silence lay heavily upon the
        city. Tor thought lovingly of his Master in the intervals between
        dreams. <span class="tei tei-q">“He has gone away <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>safely with the men,”</span> he told
        himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall again find him, and he will
        heal blind folk as before.”</span> So drowsing and murmuring soft
        prayers to his invisible Father, the beggar child rested in the house
        of Pilate, while without the walls of the city his Master, the King,
        was already hanging upon the cross.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within the great
        kitchens of the palace cooks were busy preparing the noonday meal;
        dishes and cups clattered cheerfully, and the merry voices of maidens
        burnishing the great wine-flagons mingled with the chirp and whir of
        sparrows flitting back and forth in the blue air.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly, and
        without warning, the bright light of the spring noon began to fail.
        There was no fog, no storm, but a veil of lurid darkness was drawn
        heavily across the sky. Doors and windows <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>were thrown wide, and terror-stricken faces
        stared up into the threatening heavens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcus, the crusty
        porter of the palace, stood fast in his place, his dull face blanched
        and terrified in the failing light. <span class="tei tei-q">“’Tis the
        vengeance of the gods,”</span> he muttered. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Man of Nazareth was innocent!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Servants and
        underlings crowded the passages in terrified groups. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Open to us, Marcus,”</span> they cried, beating upon the
        doors till they trembled upon their heavy hinges. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Earthquake!”</span> wailed a voice from without.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The gods are shaking this evil
        city!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The porter drew
        the great bolts with tremulous haste, and with one accord all rushed
        into the street.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scarcely knowing
        how it had befallen, the beggar child found himself on the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167"
        id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>street with the others,
        running—running he knew not whither, through empty streets which
        echoed his light footfalls as in the dead of night.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somewhere, afar
        off, there was the tumult of a great multitude. Tor stopped to
        listen, then ran on, thinking of his Master, who was waiting for him
        in the fast-gathering darkness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He reached a
        gate—which gate he knew not, but it yawned wide and unguarded. Not
        far away Tor could hear the frightened sobbing of women, the strong
        curses of terrified men, the wailing of little children, blending
        with the hurried trampling of myriad feet. Suddenly athwart the
        darkness flamed a blood-red, silent flash illumining the heavens from
        east to west. Against this lurid background loomed three crosses,
        stark and black. And now across the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>gloomy valleys sounded the sullen crash of
        rocks, the fall of giant trees, while the sick earth groaned aloud
        and trembled beneath its terrible burden.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor stood
        stock-still in the midst of the road. In that instant of frozen
        horror he comprehended what had happened. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, my Father,”</span> he groaned, the foundations of
        his childish faith reeling with the reeling earth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the Omnipotent
        Love answered this feeble cry of the least of his children, even as
        it answered that far-reaching, agonized appeal which was sounding
        forth from Calvary. And so in a moment—or an eternity—the heavens
        cleared and the April sun shone brightly upon the crosses with their
        piteous burdens, upon the terror-stricken multitudes returning to
        doomed Jerusalem, upon riven tombs and shattered moun<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tains, upon a little child, comforted of
        his Father, gazing with Christ-touched eyes upon the cross of his
        King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They took away the
        body of Jesus before sunset, wrapping it in fine white linen and
        odorous spices, and laying it to rest in a garden hard by. Tor
        watched all, understanding little of the significance of the
        rock-hewn tomb, of the great stone before its door, of the Roman
        guard which was shortly stationed before the sealed
        sepulchre.</p><a name="image168" id="image168" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center">
          <a href="images/p168.jpg"><img src="images/p168.jpg" alt=
          "“HIS WICKED FACE DISFIGURED WITH RAGE AND PAIN.”" /></a>

          <div class="tei tei-head" style=
          "text-align: center; margin-top: 1.00em; margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: center">“HIS WICKED
            FACE DISFIGURED WITH RAGE AND PAIN.”</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When all was
        finished the child returned to the city, sustained by some strange
        expectation which he could have explained to no one. As he would have
        entered the gate he came upon a woeful figure standing without and
        beating upon its breast. It was Chelluh, his wicked face disfigured
        with rage and pain. <span class="tei tei-q">“My eyes,”</span> he
        groaned. <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sight of that accursed cross burnt them like a
        devouring flame.”</span> And so it was. And so will it ever be. He
        who can look upon that cross of agony without tears of love and pity,
        henceforth sees only the blackness of darkness. The eyes of his soul
        are withered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor led the blind
        man to his old place by the gate, and fetched him his cup, his staff,
        and his water-gourd.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now go, little dog, buy me oil and wine,”</span> cried
        the beggar, with one of his frightful maledictions, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and return to me quickly, for I am devoured with this
        flame.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Tor, looking
        upon him sorrowfully, knew that he could no more serve this evil
        master as in the old days. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have done thus
        far for thee,”</span> he said in his clear childish voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“because of the King, my Master, and because
        of my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name=
        "Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Father in heaven. But I
        can no longer abide in thy presence. Farewell!”</span> And with this
        he was gone, his naked feet making no sound upon the stones of the
        street.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many days
        thereafter did Chelluh send forth his dolorous cry for alms in the
        doomed city of Jerusalem, for he lived until the terrible days of the
        Roman siege, perishing at last of hunger in his chosen place by the
        Damascus gate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the green
        garden-close, hard by Calvary, where the Roman guard paced
        ceaselessly back and forth before that silent tomb, Tor lingered,
        unnoticed and unafraid as the birds that flitted among the branches
        of the blossoming trees. It comforted him to be near the
        resting-place of his Master; and the lusty life of the young summer
        sent vague thrills of expectancy through his brown limbs, as
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172"
        id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he lay upon the warm earth
        watching the shifting leaf-shadows playing upon the sealed door of
        the sepulchre, and the slow-moving figures of the guard clad in the
        scarlet and gold of imperial Rome.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Toward midnight of
        the second night, when the great passover moon rode high in the
        heavens and the garden slept in its silver light like the garden of a
        dream, the child slept, too, held in the soft clasp of a vision which
        laid cool fingers of delight on his drowsy lids. When he awoke he lay
        for a full minute staring into the branches of the olive-tree above
        his head. The gray-green leaves were all alive with a tremulous
        motion in the fresh morning breeze; a newly-awakened bird trilled
        softly somewhere in the depths of the garden; the aromatic breath of
        serried lilies swept his cheek like a caress. It was happiness
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173"
        id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to have slept—to be once more
        awake. Then he remembered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman guard
        had disappeared; this much Tor perceived at a single glance. A second
        searching stare told him much more: the door of the tomb gaped wide,
        beside it stood a young man clad in white garments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor approached
        this radiant figure unafraid. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is the
        man who opens eyes?”</span> he asked quite simply, for the empty tomb
        appeared nothing strange to the child newly emerged from his healing
        dreams.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is not here,”</span> the young man made answer, with
        grave sweetness. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is risen, as he said.
        Behold he goeth before you into Galilee; there shalt thou see
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tor opened wide
        eyes of rapture upon the angel. <span class="tei tei-q">“My Master is
        alive!”</span> he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg
        174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>whispered to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        shall see him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He turned as if in
        a dream, his naked feet making no sound as he brushed, light as the
        dawn, past the ranks of lilies. There was a woman yonder. She was
        weeping with a smothered sound of long-drawn sobs. Tor laughed softly
        in his joy. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is alive!”</span> he repeated
        under his breath.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he saw with
        wonder that the woman was no longer alone. She was speaking to the
        Risen One, her voice wrenched with sobbing: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou
        hast laid him, and I will take him away.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child’s
        Christ-touched eyes knew him though the woman did not. He sank to his
        knees, his face shining with the dazzling light of the new day.</p>

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Master he had scorned drove him forth like a
        scourge.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He scarce noticed
        that John, the beloved disciple, was with him, running evenly at his
        side. Then some murmured word of that other disciple brought a faint
        memory of words spoken and straightway forgotten, words of painful
        prophecy, of unearthly hope, which he himself had rejected with scorn
        and impatience. The Galilean faltered, lagged behind. And so it came
        to pass that John was first to reach the open tomb.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rosy light of
        the new day shone softly into the shadowy sepulchre, revealing the
        rough-hewn walls, the shallow niche wherein the body had lain, the
        folded cere-cloths, the scattered spices. The place was fragrant,
        bright, mysteriously empty.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter stared in at
        the small, still, empty place, those half-awakened memories stirring
        strangely within him. <span class="tei tei-q">“When I have arisen
        from the dead,”</span> he murmured half unconsciously. Had the Master
        indeed uttered those strange words, or was his brain touched with
        some sweet madness? He turned to John. The eyes of the beloved
        disciple were fastened upon the empty niche, his lips moved as in
        prayer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With sudden,
        hard-won resolution Peter entered the tomb, stooping to look more
        closely at the chill, empty bed with its array of fair linen and
        odorous spicery. He noticed with an awed tightening of the throat
        that the fine linen napkin which had been wound about the dead man’s
        head was not lying with the other cerements, but was folded carefully
        apart, as if the wearer, sitting upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the edge of his couch, had placed it there with
        a tender thought of the giver.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His bewildered,
        grief-stricken eyes met the look of dawning hope in the eyes of the
        other. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is not here,”</span> murmured
        John, <span class="tei tei-q">“he is risen!”</span> And on a sudden
        his face became radiant with angelic beauty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the two went
        away in wondering silence to their own house, and as they went they
        met other women of their company who told them of angels waiting
        within the tomb with that question which still sounds in ears
        grief-sealed against the truth of Omnipresent Life: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why seek ye the living among the dead? Go, tell his
        disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye
        see him, as he said unto you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Galilee,
        therefore, after certain days of growing hope and marvelous
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179"
        id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>vision, the disciples journeyed
        in great numbers, and with them went a certain small lad, of a joyous
        and shining face, no longer a homeless beggar of Jerusalem, but a
        brother beloved because he had looked upon the King in the beauty of
        his resurrection body.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was one of the
        women, called Salome, who first came upon the child as he walked
        slowly toward Jerusalem in the dawning day. The little lad was
        chanting softly to himself the words he had learned on the day of his
        healing: <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna! Hosanna in the highest!
        Blessed—blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
        King!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why dost thou sing, child?”</span> asked the woman
        querulously. She was still bearing the burden of spicery which she
        had fetched to the empty tomb, and her eyes were red with weeping and
        anxiety.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg
        180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I sing,”</span> answered Tor, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“because my Master, the King, is alive. He opened my
        eyes, which were blind as night, and with these eyes have I seen
        him—alive! Therefore, I sing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The woman shook
        her head sorrowfully, for the thing was yet too wonderful for her
        understanding. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have seen the empty
        tomb,”</span> she said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Also I beheld a
        young man clad in white garments, who declared to us that he was
        alive; but I know not what to think. How can it be that he is alive
        when he was dead—crucified—pierced with a spear?”</span> And again
        she wept bitterly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I saw him,”</span> said Tor simply,—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the man who opened my eyes. He is alive. I am going to
        Galilee to see him.”</span> And once more the child cried,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna!”</span> with a clear, jubilant
        voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whose child art thou, little one?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said the woman, marveling at the
        brightness of his eyes, which, indeed, shone like the eyes of the
        angel at the empty tomb. <span class="tei tei-q">“And where dost thou
        live?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have a Father in heaven,”</span> said Tor,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and once I had a master who was blind and a
        beggar; but him I serve no longer, since I serve only the King who
        gave me my eyes.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And when, by dint
        of questioning the lad, the woman found that he was without kindred
        and alone in the world, she took him to her own house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so it happened
        that Tor traveled with that great concourse of disciples who went to
        Galilee to keep the tryst with their risen Lord.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Tor met
        Peter, the Galilean. It was on this wise: the child, enchanted with
        the beauty of the lake, wandered upon the shore at evening, his eyes
        wist<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name=
        "Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fully following the
        fishermen as they put out one after another upon the radiant water.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I should like to sail away in a
        boat,”</span> murmured Tor to himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked up to
        find the eyes of Peter fixed upon him. <span class="tei tei-q">“How
        camest thou hither, small one?”</span> asked the fisherman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I came from Jerusalem with the woman who is called
        Salome,”</span> answered Tor. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am come to
        see my Master, who was dead and is alive again. Already I have seen
        him. And I shall again see him. Perhaps,”</span> he added timidly,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he is there.”</span> The child’s small
        finger pointed to the lake, which glowed like a sea of lambent fire
        in the dying light.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Once he came to us walking upon the water,”</span> said
        the fisherman thoughtfully. After a little his eyes wandered to his
        boats, drawn high and empty upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the shore. There were others of his old comrades
        near at hand, and to these Peter presently called out with something
        of his old energy: <span class="tei tei-q">“I go a fishing,”</span>
        he said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We also go with thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so the boat
        was made ready, with nets and lanterns, and rough fisher’s gear for
        possible wild weather in the night watches. Tor watched the
        preparations with shining eyes. When all was at length finished he
        bowed himself before Peter after his old mendicant’s fashion.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray thee, honorable Galilean, that I also
        may go fishing,”</span> he said timidly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter stared down
        at him in some perplexity. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is it that
        brings thee ever athwart my path, small one?”</span> he asked, not
        unkindly. <span class="tei tei-q">“In Jerusalem <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thou wast verily like my shadow—and now,
        thou wilt fish.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I want to see my Master, the King,”</span> answered Tor.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He is there.”</span> Again the small finger
        pointed to the darkening lake and the solemn blue mountains beyond.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is so beautiful he will be there,”</span>
        he repeated softly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, then,”</span> said Peter, and, catching up the
        little lad, he stowed him snugly in the bow of the great clumsy
        fishing-craft amid a pile of nets.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through stretches
        of moonlit water, where the breeze rippled keenly, in the dark lee of
        swelling hills, now anchored, now drifting slowly under the winking
        stars, the fishermen bent to their work. And through the long hours
        Tor lay quite still in the place where he was bid, speaking to no
        one, but wrapped in a dream of perfect delight, which the men
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185"
        id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>busied with their fruitless
        fishing could scarce have understood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, now, the
        darkest hour, that comes before dawn, was already past, and the white
        mist that shrouded sea and shore and drifted light as thistle-down
        upon the glassy surface of the nearer water began to glow with rose
        and amber tints of dawn, Tor wriggled his lithe little body from its
        nest of coats and stood upright in the bow. His great bright eyes
        were fixed upon the wavering curtains of the mist. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Listen!”</span> he cried suddenly, in his clear, shrill
        voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A long, level ray
        from the rising sun burst through the vanishing clouds and rested
        full upon the land not many furlongs distant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Look!”</span> cried the child again, and pointed with
        his finger.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
        186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some one—a man—was
        standing upon the pebbly shore looking out over the water. The
        fishermen rubbed their tired eyes and stared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Children, have ye aught to eat?”</span> A clear, human
        voice brought the little cheerful question across the narrowing
        space.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> shouted the fishermen, satisfied that the
        friendly voice belonged to some wayfarer, curious as ever to know the
        luck of an all-night fishing expedition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cast the net on the right side of the boat and ye shall
        find,”</span> came the answer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perchance he sees the ripple of a shoal,”</span>
        muttered Peter, and heaved the great net for another cast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the net
        sank with its weight of struggling fish. Two of the men leaped
        hastily into the small boat to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>secure the catch, but Peter and John were gazing
        past the heaving net at that solitary figure upon the shore.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is the Lord,”</span> whispered John. And Peter, with
        a smothered cry of love and longing, girt his fisher’s coat about him
        and flung himself into the water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon the shore
        burned a fire of coals, and upon it sputtered a great fish, giving
        forth appetizing odors to the cool morning air. Beside the fire were
        piled loaves such as the common people were wont to use with this
        broiled fish. It was all quite homely and natural, yet the hands that
        busied themselves with that simple, satisfying meal bore the mark of
        the nails.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fishermen
        stood with bowed heads, no one daring to ask the question which
        trembled on every lip.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come and break your fast,”</span> said <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their mysterious host, smiling upon their
        awe-stricken silence. And he took the bread and the fish and gave
        them to eat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So when they had
        broken their fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than
        these?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter answered in
        a half whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yea, Lord; thou knowest that
        I love thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Feed my lambs.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He said to him a
        second time, <span class="tei tei-q">“Simon, son of John, lovest thou
        me?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Peter
        answered with an anguished glance of entreaty, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again came the
        command, <span class="tei tei-q">“Feed my sheep.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He said to him the
        third time, <span class="tei tei-q">“Simon, son of John, lovest thou
        me?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Peter burst
        into a great passion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg
        189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        weeping, and wept as on the night he had denied his Master.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord,”</span> he cried out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love
        thee!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Feed my sheep.”</span> Other words spake he
        also which they that heard forgot no more either in time or in
        eternity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus did Peter,
        the Galilean, who was also called Simon, son of John, answer his
        Master three times by Gennesaret water; and thus was the bitter
        memory of his three denials purged from his soul. Verily he loved
        much, and was therefore forgiven much. And to the end of his days he
        remembered right well both to cherish the lambs committed to his care
        by the Upper Shepherd, and to tend and feed the sheep both in fold
        and in pasture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So it was that he
        no more spoke care<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
        190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>lessly or slightingly to the little lad, Tor,
        but, counting him as a special charge from his risen Lord, he became
        to him even as a father.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Tor, growing
        into manhood, learned many things both strange and beautiful from the
        world’s page; but he found nothing there to blot out the memory of
        the Man who had opened his eyes. To the end he followed the King, his
        Master, and Jesus, long since received into the visible heavens over
        Galilee, yet remained with him, a sweet and satisfying presence.</p>

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
